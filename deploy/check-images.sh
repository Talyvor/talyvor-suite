# Does a published image exist for each service's CURRENT main, and does :latest point at it?
# Four verdicts, because three of them need different responses:
#   OK       — :sha exists and :latest is the same image. Deploy.
#   MISSING  — no image was ever published for this commit. Re-run the image workflow.
#   STALE    — an image exists for this commit but :latest is a DIFFERENT build
#              (a re-run pushed an older commit over it). Deploy by digest, not :latest.
#   BUILDING — images.yaml is queued or running for this SHA right now. WAIT, do not investigate.
#              Builds take 8-13 minutes, so every merge leaves a window where main is ahead of the
#              registry. This is the state I first reported as MISSING; the fix is to ask GitHub,
#              because the registry cannot tell you about work in flight.
#   NO-BUILD — no run exists AND the commit touches no path images.yaml watches (docs/LICENSE
#              only). No image is expected; :latest correctly still points at the previous
#              commit, and deploying it is right.
#   UNKNOWN  — the registry lookup itself failed (network/auth/rate limit). NOT the same as
#              MISSING: treating a hiccup as "no image" is how you re-run a build you already have.
#
# "Absent" is never one state. It is at least never-existed, not-yet, not-expected, and
# lookup-failed — and each wants a different thing from you.
# Lowercase: an image name must be. GitHub calls the organisation "Talyvor" and treats the name in any
# letter case as the same, so this one value serves the registry, git and gh alike.
