# Full-stack deploy — Lens + suite + Track + Docs, all at once

**This extends [`README.md`](./README.md); it does not replace it.** README covers
the box, the service user, systemd, Caddy and the Track/Docs mechanics, and all
of that still holds. What it does not know is that the **suite now provisions a
Lens workspace per person**, which changes the BFF's environment from *optional
extra* to *hard prerequisite*, and puts **Lens first in the order**.

This deploy is not degradable. Four services move together and three of the
couplings are shared secrets that fail in opposite directions — one side silently
401s, the other refuses to boot. Follow the steps in order. Every step ends with a
command and the exact output that means "continue".

## Verified against these commits

Read from `origin` at the time of writing, not from a local checkout:

| Repo | `origin/main` |
|---|---|
| talyvor-suite | `2d239d7` feat(notice): tell testers Docs is shared, and refuse TRACK_WORKSPACE_ID (#37) |
| talyvor-lens | `2f1b95e` fix(cache): bind every stored vector to the embedder that produced it (#379) |
| talyvor-track | `98d0f6c` feat(workspace): idempotent per-identity bootstrap (#63) |
| talyvor-docs | `c8d9053` test(testutil): FAIL without a database instead of skipping (#44) |

Re-run STEP 0 below before you start; if a SHA has moved, the image check is
what catches it.

## What changed since README was written

Verified from source, with the file and line so you can re-check rather than
trust this table.

| Change | Verified at | Failure if ignored |
|---|---|---|
| BFF **requires** `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET` | `apps/bff/main.go:133` | Refuses to start, names itself |
| BFF **refuses to boot** if `LENS_API_KEY` is set | `apps/bff/main.go:142` | Refuses to start, names itself |
| BFF no longer reads `LENS_WORKSPACE_KEY` / `_ID` | absent from `apps/bff/*.go` | Silently ignored — they do nothing now |
| Lens fails **closed** without `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET` | `cmd/lens/provision_handler.go` `mountProvisionRoute` returns early on `""` | Route not registered → provisioning 404 → **every login fails** |
| Lens migration count is **derived, never quoted** | `ls migrations/*.sql \| wc -l` in the checkout | A number written here goes stale on the next merge and then STEP 2b fails for the wrong reason |
| Track migrates by **subcommand** | `cmd/track/main.go:132` (`os.Args[1] == "migrate"`) | Empty schema, every call 500s |
| Docs migrates **on boot**, fail-closed | `cmd/docs/main.go:162` `migrate.Apply` before serving | — (it self-applies; a failure is a boot failure) |
| Track/Docs **reject published placeholder secrets** | `internal/config/config.go:137` in both | Refuses to boot |

> **Note (cosmetic, not blocking):** `apps/bff/auth.go:14-15` still carries a
> comment describing the old one-workspace model. It is stale prose, not
> behaviour. Worth a follow-up; it changes nothing here.

## ⚠ Read this once, before step 0: status is not capability

Every `docker compose ps`, every `/healthz`, every "healthy" in this deploy is a claim
about a **process**: it started, it is listening, it has not crashed. None of them is a
claim about a **capability**.

Lens passes every liveness check in this document with provisioning off, pooling off,
billing off and `lens.env` missing entirely. That is not a bug in the healthcheck — a
healthcheck that went red because an optional feature was unconfigured would take the
gateway out of rotation for no reason. It is simply answering a different question from
the one you are asking.

**So: never read `ps`, `healthy` or a 200 from `/healthz` as a deploy verdict.** Each
capability below has its own check that *exercises the capability* — provisioning is
proven by a 401 from the route, pooling by three gates and a similarity margin, billing
by a row count that increases. Where a step has no such check, it says so in
"Steps that cannot be fully verified" near the end, rather than letting a green status
stand in for one.

This is the single generalisation behind most of the traps in this document. It is
stated here once instead of five times.

### ⚠ EVERY DECISION IN THIS DOCUMENT HAS AN EXECUTABLE EXPIRY

> **`deploy/decision-expiry.sh` — run in CI on every push.**

A decision here is not "X is true". It is **"X, *because* premise P"** — and P is usually a
limitation, which is the most perishable kind of fact, because a limitation is exactly what
someone is working to remove. Three decisions in one night were correct when made and wrong an
hour later for that reason. Nothing was careless; the premise was verified from source each
time. The structural fault is that **the verdict is written in timeless present tense and the
premise is buried in the justification**, so the next reader meets the conclusion and never
re-derives what holds it up.

So each one carries a command, not a description. Strongest form available, always:

| form | example here |
|---|---|
| **1. Fails to COMPILE** | suite #59 made the shared-Docs disclosure a compile error rather than a silently-false string. Use this whenever the fact can be *derived* instead of restated. |
| **2. A TEST that fails** | `TestDocs_IsPerSessionNotPinned` — reintroduce the pin and it fails, naming the runbook section that is thereby void. ⚠ It must exercise the **production path**: in talyvor-docs an expiry driving a *fake* kept passing after its premise was gone, because the fake was adjusted for unrelated and locally sensible reasons. |
| **3. A documented command** | `deploy/decision-expiry.sh`. Weakest, used where 1 and 2 cannot reach. |

⚠ **The script reports cross-repo premises as `UNCHECKABLE`, never as passes.** Four of our
decisions rest on facts in talyvor-track and talyvor-docs, which it cannot read. That set is
where *"someone will notice"* is still doing the work — it is printed on every run precisely so
it does not read as an empty list. Run those commands, in the named repo, before a deploy.

---

### ⚠ THE TEST FOR ANY CHECK YOU ADD TO THIS DOCUMENT

> **What does this check print in the FAILURE state, and is that distinguishable from
> success?**

Apply it before adding a step. Five checks in this file have failed it — enough that the
next one will too unless the rule sits where people are working. Every one had the same
shape: **the failure branch was unreachable for the state the check was written to
detect.**

| The check | What it printed when the thing was broken |
|---|---|
| `printenv VAR \|\| echo SHUT` | `printenv` exits **0** and prints a blank line for a variable that is set-but-**empty** — which is exactly what the `lens.env` trap produces. The `\|\|` branch never ran. |
| `sha256sum` on both sides of a secret compare | Two **missing** values both digest to `e3b0c44298fc1c14`, so the comparison printed **MATCH** with nothing configured anywhere. |
| `docker compose logs --since 2m \| grep POOLING` | That line is emitted only when the decision **changes**, so the window is empty in steady state — and empty read as fine. |
| Seed rows confirmed right after the `INSERT` | They always exist right after an INSERT; the prune that deletes them runs later, and if sync is unconfigured it never runs at all. |
| `count(*) … # expect a number that INCREASED` | No baseline was ever captured, so the check could not be evaluated — and a check that cannot be evaluated cannot fail. |
| `allowlist=%d entries` at BFF boot | `OIDC_ALLOWED_EMAILS=*` is stored as the one-element slice `["*"]`, so wide-open printed `allowlist=1 entries` — identical to one permitted address, and reading like the safe state. |
| `grep -c GATEWAY_AUTH_SECRET .env  # expect: 2` | `printf` writes both variable NAMES whether or not the values are set, so this prints **2 with both secrets empty**. Tested. Count non-empty assignments: `grep -cE '^(TRACK\|DOCS)_GATEWAY_AUTH_SECRET=.+'`. |

⚠ **AND THE SAME QUESTION APPLIES TO LOG OUTPUT, not just to checks.** A boot line is a check
the operator runs by reading. On the live deploy, with `OIDC_ALLOWED_EMAILS=*`, the BFF printed:

```
bff: auth=oidc issuer=… public=… allowlist=1 entries
```

That reads as **one permitted address**. It meant the opposite — every identity the issuer
authenticates — because `"*"` is represented as the one-element slice `["*"]`. One address and
unlimited addresses produced the identical string, and the string reads as the restrictive one.
An operator read it as closed and nearly "fixed" a working configuration; only `/auth/me`'s
`signup_open` told the truth. Nothing below the line was wrong: the count was accurate, and
meaningless.

**A count is the wrong shape whenever a sentinel value can change what the collection means.**
It now prints the STATE:

```
allowlist=OPEN — every identity this issuer authenticates
allowlist=restricted to 3 addresses
```

Three habits that come out of it, and they are cheap:

1. **Compare values, not exit codes** — and print the value you got.
2. **Make "absent" its own word.** Never let a digest, a count or a blank line stand in
   for it; `ABSENT` is not `e3b0c442…`.
3. **Capture the baseline before the action**, whenever the expectation is "it changed".

> ⚠ **Before you read any log in this document, read the EXPECTED NOISE section near the end.**
> It is placed there for reference, but several steps below tell you to open the logs —
> STEP 3a's reconcile, STEP 6b's pooling line — and two of the lines you will find there
> are permanent and harmless while one is a real fault wearing the same shape. Reading it
> only when you reach it means reading it after you have already drawn a conclusion.

## ⚠ Reading verification output: on the app origin, 200 does not mean "it is there"

A sibling of the above, for a different reason, and it changes how you write checks
against `app.talyvor.com` / `127.0.0.1:8787`.

**The BFF serves the SPA, and falls back to `index.html` for any path that is not a real
file — EXCEPT the paths the build owns, which 404.** So on that origin:

| path | what a 200 means |
|---|---|
| `/api/…`, `/auth/…` | a real handler answered — the code is meaningful |
| `/assets/…`, `/version.json` | **the file is really there.** These do not fall back; a missing one is a 404. |
| anything else | **`index.html` was served.** Says nothing about the path existing. |

**Measured** against a `web-dist` containing *only* `index.html` — no assets, no
`version.json`:

| request | code | content-type | `curl -f` exit |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | 200 | text/html | **0** |
| `/version.json` | **404** | text/plain | 22 |
| `/billing/success` | 200 | text/html | **0** |
| `/ledger` | 200 | text/html | **0** |
| `/assets/index-nope.js` | **404** | text/plain | 22 |
| `/api/version` | 200 | application/json | 0 |
| `/api/nope` | **404** | application/json | 22 |

Consequences, in order of how easy they are to get wrong:

1. **`curl -f` and `-w '%{http_code}'` cannot verify that a CLIENT-SIDE ROUTE exists** on
   this origin. They succeed unconditionally — see the `0`s in the last column. That is
   every SPA route: `/ledger`, `/setup`, and the `LENS_BILLING_SUCCESS_URL` landing page
   `/billing/success`. A post-purchase page that was never built into the bundle answers
   200 exactly like one that was, because a client route is not a file and the router
   decides what it means. **A STATIC FILE IS DIFFERENT — see (2).**
2. ✅ **A MISSING ASSET NOW ANSWERS 404** — row five, and `/version.json` in row two. It
   did not always: both used to return **200 with `index.html`**, which is the failure
   mode of a partial `rsync` (`index.html` lands, `assets/` does not) and of a browser
   holding the previous deploy's `index.html`. Measured in Chrome against a bundle whose
   `index.html` named hashes that were not on disk: four requests, **all 200**, `#root`
   empty, zero stylesheet rules, one console line about a MIME type — a white screen with
   nothing on the wire to see it by. The status code is now the check:
   ```sh
   JS=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/ | grep -oE '/assets/index-[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.js' | head -1)
   curl -sf -o /dev/null "http://127.0.0.1:8787$JS" || echo "the asset index.html names is MISSING"
   ```
   ⚠ This does **not** make the app render — nothing can conjure a file that is not
   there. It makes the breakage *detectable*, by curl, by a monitor, and in a browser's
   network panel. `apps/bff/spa_fallback_test.go` holds the rule and the measurements.
3. **`curl / → 200` proves `index.html` exists, not that the bundle is complete or
   current.** Assets are separate files; check the one `index.html` names, as in (2).
4. **For a client route, require content, not status.** `| jq -e '.field'` for JSON, a
   content-type or `grep -o` for everything else. Where what you want to prove is "the
   deployed bundle is the one I built", use the version comparison in STEP 6d — that is
   what it is for.

`/api/…` is the exception, and the last two rows show why: the `/api/` catch-all returns
a genuine **404**, so codes on `/api/…` routes discriminate real states. STEP 6's
Track/Docs table (200 / 401 / 403 / 404 / 502 / 503 → one cause each) is correct as
written for exactly that reason.

This does **not** apply to Lens, Track or Docs: they have no SPA fallback, so a 404 there
genuinely means "not mounted" (STEP 7's `400` vs `404` on the webhook route depends on
exactly that, and is correct as written).

---

## ⚠ Where each command runs, and what that host must already have

A runbook that fails at step one is worse than one that fails at step ten. **Three
different hosts** appear below and the commands are not interchangeable.

| Host | What it is | Must already have |
|---|---|---|
| **workstation** | your laptop | `git`, `docker` (logged in to `ghcr.io`, `read:packages`), **`gh`** (authenticated), `pnpm`, `go`, `ssh`, `shasum` |
| **app box** | runs the BFF (host systemd) + the Caddy/Lens compose stack | `docker compose`, `psql` via the postgres container, `ss`, `sudo` |
| **lens box** | in this deployment, the **same machine** as the app box — Caddy and Lens are containers there | the `talyvor-lens` checkout, beside which `lens.env` must live |

### ⚠ `check-images.sh` runs on the WORKSTATION, from the suite checkout

You already clone the suite there to build the BFF (README §2), so **no extra clone is
needed** — it is the same checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Talyvor/talyvor-suite.git && cd talyvor-suite
bash deploy/check-images.sh
```

It does **not** need lens/track/docs checked out. It asks the GitHub API for each
commit's file list rather than reading a local repo, precisely because the workstation
is unlikely to have all four. It needs **`gh` authenticated** — without it every
service reports `UNKNOWN`, not a false OK.

**Do not run it on the app box.** That machine has the lens checkout but typically no
`gh` and no ghcr login, so it would report `UNKNOWN` across the board and read as an
outage.

### Prerequisites the steps below assume, and where to get them

| Needed by | Prerequisite | If missing |
|---|---|---|
| STEP 0 | `gh auth login`; `docker login ghcr.io` | every verdict is `UNKNOWN` |
| STEP 2a-bis | the `talyvor-lens` checkout on the app box | the long-tail settings have nowhere to live — and a curated variable put in `lens.env` is silently discarded |
| STEP 3 | ⚠ **the `talyvor-track` and `talyvor-docs` checkouts ARE needed on the box** — not for the images (those are pulled), but because the migration checks compare against `ls migrations/*.sql`. Clone them, or read the two numbers on your workstation and substitute them. | the count check cannot run, and `> 0` is not a substitute — it passes on a partial migration |
| STEP 5 | the suite checkout on the workstation (build host) | nothing to ship |
| STEP 7 | the `stripe` CLI **on the workstation**, logged in | the webhook-records proof cannot be run; do NOT enable billing without it |
| 6c / 7 | `psql` is reached via `docker compose exec postgres`, so no host psql is needed | — |

⚠ **The `stripe` CLI is the one prerequisite that is easy to discover too late** — it
is needed in the middle of the billing sequence, after the values are already in place.
Install and `stripe login` before starting STEP 7.

---

## STEP 0 — image preflight. Do this before touching the server.

**Nothing else in this document is safe to start until this passes.** Today a
Lens image build failed twice on a Docker Hub timeout, and a re-run pushed an
**older** commit over `:latest`. The check that was run could not tell "no image
for this commit" from "an image exists but `:latest` points somewhere else" —
those need different responses, so the check must distinguish them.

All three services publish `:latest` **and** `:<full-sha>` to
`ghcr.io/talyvor/talyvor-<svc>` (verified: lens `images.yaml:54-56`,
track `ci.yaml:354-356`, docs `ci.yaml:324-326`). Until the repositories moved to the
Talyvor organisation on 12 Oct 2026 the images were under `ghcr.io/gaboracnicolai`.

```sh
# Run on your workstation. Needs: docker logged in to ghcr.io (read:packages).
bash deploy/check-images.sh    # exits non-zero unless all three are OK
```

**Tested against the live registry, not written from the API docs.** Three things
that only showed up by running it, each of which would have made the check lie:

1. **`<none>` as a shell placeholder breaks under zsh** — it is parsed as a
   redirection inside `${var:-<none>}`, so every lookup reported absent. The
   script uses bare words.
2. **A registry hiccup is indistinguishable from an absent tag** if you only test
   for empty output. A transient failure and a genuinely missing image both give
   you nothing. The script reads stderr and separates them: `not found` /
   `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN` ⇒ **MISSING**, anything else ⇒ **UNKNOWN**. Treating a
   hiccup as MISSING is how you re-run a build you already have — or worse,
   conclude an image is fine when the lookup never happened.
3. **Image tags are the FULL 40-character SHA.** A short SHA silently resolves to
   nothing, which reads as MISSING. The script takes the SHA from `git ls-remote`
   so it cannot be truncated by hand.



**Expect: `OK` on all three lines.** Anything else, and what to do:

| Verdict | What it means | Do this |
|---|---|---|
| `MISSING` | The image workflow never succeeded for this commit (the Docker Hub timeout case). | Re-run the image workflow **for that exact SHA**: `gh workflow run images.yaml --repo Talyvor/talyvor-lens --ref main`. Wait, then re-run STEP 0. |
| `STALE` | An image for this commit exists, but `:latest` was overwritten by a later re-run of an **older** commit — exactly what happened today. | **Do not deploy `:latest`.** Pin the compose/unit to `:<sha>` for that service (see the note under each service's step), or re-run the workflow so `:latest` is re-pushed from this commit. |
| `NO-LATEST` | Tag missing entirely. | Same as `MISSING` — re-run the workflow. |
| `UNKNOWN` | The **lookup** failed — network, auth, or rate limit. **Not** the same as MISSING. | Retry. Do not re-run a build on the strength of this, and do not deploy: you have learned nothing about the image either way. |

Why digests and not `docker pull`: pulling `:latest` and reading its labels
tells you what you *got*, not whether it *matches main*. Comparing the two tags'
manifest digests answers the actual question, and reports `<none>` distinctly
from a mismatch — which is the distinction that failed today.

> **If you must proceed with `STALE`:** pin by digest, never by `:latest`.
> `image: ghcr.io/talyvor/talyvor-lens@sha256:<by_sha digest>` is
> unambiguous and immune to a later re-push.

### ⚠ STEP 0b — after the LAST merge, wait for the image. This is a step, not a note.

**Every merge leaves a window of roughly 8-13 minutes in which main is ahead of the
registry.** Deploy inside it and `docker compose pull` fetches `:latest` from the
*previous* commit — which is how a stale image got deployed earlier today. The stack
comes up healthy and runs code you did not merge.

The check above reports **BUILDING** with elapsed minutes for exactly this. It is a
distinct verdict from MISSING because it wants the opposite response: wait, do not
investigate and do not re-run.

```sh
# Watch until every service is OK. Re-run after your last merge, not before it.
until bash deploy/check-images.sh; do echo "  …waiting"; sleep 60; done
echo "all images match main — safe to deploy"
```

**How long is too long,** derived from this repo's own runs rather than guessed —
11 of 12 recent lens builds finished in **8.3–12.2 min**, and **one took 60.1 min and
still succeeded**:

| Elapsed | Read it as |
|---|---|
| ≤ 15 min | Normal. Wait. |
| 15–45 min | Slow, but a 60-minute build has succeeded here. Keep waiting. |
| > 45 min | Past anything observed. Open the run before deploying — this is where "BUILDING forever" would otherwise become its own silence. |

A flat "40 minutes means stuck" would have condemned that 60-minute build, which is
why the bands come from measurement.

**Config-only merges produce no image, by design.** `images.yaml` is path-filtered to
`cmd/ internal/ migrations/ go.mod go.sum Dockerfile .github/workflows/images.yaml`.
Verified against history: `a41dd89`, `cc67661` and `6e78c37` (LICENSE/docs only) have
no image and needed none — the check calls that **NO-BUILD**, not MISSING, and `:latest`
correctly still points at the previous commit.

⚠ **But the filter does not watch `docker-compose.yaml`.** A merge that changes *only*
compose produces no image — so a compose fix reaches the server through `git pull` on
the Lens checkout, not through the registry. (The compose-plumbing merge `30c3f50` did
build, but only because it also touched test files under `cmd/**`. Do not rely on that.)

---

### ⚠ STEP 0c — build-time environment for the web bundle

`VITE_*` variables are read by `vite build` **from the shell that runs it** and baked into
the bundle. They are not runtime config: setting one on the app host after the fact changes
nothing, and the only way to fix a wrong value is another build.

**`VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL` — currently unset, and that is why the marketing page shows no email CTA.**
This is deliberate. The page previously hardcoded `hello@talyvor.com` under a comment saying the
alias did not route yet; it shipped anyway, and a buyer's first action went nowhere. The address is
now configuration and its absence is a state the page renders — unset means no email CTA is drawn
at all, rather than a dead one. There is no fallback address on purpose.

```sh
# On the workstation, at build time. Only after the alias ACTUALLY DELIVERS.
VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL=hello@talyvor.com ./scripts/build-release.sh web
```

⚠ **Send a test message to the address and confirm it arrives BEFORE setting this.** Setting it
while the alias still bounces re-creates the exact defect the gate was built to prevent, and this
time with no comment to notice.

```sh
# Verify the built bundle actually carries it, before shipping.
grep -c 'hello@talyvor.com' apps/web/dist/assets/*.js
# expect: at least one match. ZERO ⇒ the variable was not in the build environment —
# a bundle built without it is indistinguishable from one built before the CTA existed.
```

## STEP 1 — generate the four shared secrets, once

⚠ **Run this on the WORKSTATION** (its verify step sshes to both boxes, so it cannot be
run on either). That matters more than it looks: **STEP 2a-bis writes `.env` on the LENS
BOX using `$PROVISION_SECRET`**, and a shell variable exported here does not exist there.
Paste the value, or re-export it in the shell you use on the Lens box — an unset variable
writes `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET=` (empty), which fails closed at STEP 2b's 404 check, three
steps later. The guard in 2a-bis refuses to write an empty value for this reason.

Four couplings, each one value under two names. Generate them together so they
cannot drift, and hold them somewhere you can paste from twice.

```sh
export PROVISION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '\n')
export TRACK_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '\n')
export DOCS_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '\n')
export MEMBER_SYNC_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 48 | tr -d '\n')
printf 'provision=%s\ntrack=%s\ndocs=%s\nmember-sync=%s\n' \
  "${PROVISION_SECRET:0:8}…" "${TRACK_SECRET:0:8}…" "${DOCS_SECRET:0:8}…" "${MEMBER_SYNC_SECRET:0:8}…"
```

| Secret | Goes into | And into |
|---|---|---|
| `PROVISION_SECRET` | Lens stack: `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET` | BFF env: `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET` (**same name**) |
| `TRACK_SECRET` | Track container: `GATEWAY_AUTH_SECRET` | BFF env: `TRACK_GATEWAY_SECRET` (**different name**) |
| `DOCS_SECRET` | Docs container: `GATEWAY_AUTH_SECRET` | BFF env: `DOCS_GATEWAY_SECRET` (**different name**) |
| `MEMBER_SYNC_SECRET` | Track container: `TRACK_MEMBER_SYNC_SECRET` | Docs container: `DOCS_TRACK_MEMBER_SYNC_SECRET` |

⚠ **The fourth is new, and it is the one the BFF never sees.** The other three are
BFF↔service couplings; this one is **Docs↔Track directly**, gating the two service
endpoints Docs pulls (`GET /v1/service/members` and `GET /v1/service/workspaces` — one
secret for both, `talyvor-track internal/member/workspaces.go`). Put it in the compose
project's `.env` as `MEMBER_SYNC_SECRET`; the track-docs fragment feeds **both** services
from that one key, so they cannot drift and the digest compare below is a formality rather
than a real risk.

⚠ Track enforces **≥ 16 chars** if it is set at all (`internal/config/config.go`
`MinMemberSyncSecretLen`), and refuses to boot below that. `openssl rand -base64 48` is
64 chars, so this is only a hazard if you substitute a hand-typed value.

**Verify — prove all three MATCH now, not three steps later.** Previously a mismatch
surfaced only as a 401 from Track/Docs or a 404 on login, which is loud but late: you
have already deployed four services by then. Compare digests at the moment you set
them. Never prints a secret.

```sh
# Run after you have written all three into their destinations.
# ⚠ `dig16` prints ABSENT rather than a digest of nothing. sha256sum('') is a
#   valid-LOOKING 16 chars (e3b0c44298fc1c14), so a naive compare of two MISSING
#   values prints MATCH with nothing configured on either side. Tested; that is
#   how this check used to pass on an empty deploy.
dig16() { v=$(cat); [ -n "$v" ] || { printf 'ABSENT\n'; return; }; printf '%s' "$v" | sha256sum | cut -c1-16; }
cmp3() { # $1=label $2=local-digest $3=remote-digest
  case "$2$3" in
    *ABSENT*) echo "$1: NOT SET on at least one side ($2 vs $3) — this is NOT a match" ;;
    *) [ "$2" = "$3" ] && echo "$1: MATCH" || echo "$1: MISMATCH ($2 vs $3) — fix it here" ;;
  esac
}

cmp3 provision "$(printf '%s' "$PROVISION_SECRET" | dig16)" \
  "$(ssh <lens-box> "grep -oP '(?<=^LENS_PROVISION_SECRET=).*' /path/to/lens/.env" | dig16)"
cmp3 track "$(printf '%s' "$TRACK_SECRET" | dig16)" \
  "$(ssh <app-box> "grep -oP '(?<=^TRACK_GATEWAY_SECRET=).*' /etc/talyvor/bff.env" | dig16)"
cmp3 docs "$(printf '%s' "$DOCS_SECRET" | dig16)" \
  "$(ssh <app-box> "grep -oP '(?<=^DOCS_GATEWAY_SECRET=).*' /etc/talyvor/bff.env" | dig16)"
# expect: three lines, all MATCH. ABSENT on either side is a FAILURE, not a mismatch —
# it means nothing is configured there yet. Fix before a single service starts.
```

#### ⚠ WHERE `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET` LIVES — settled, because two steps used to disagree

**One value, two files, and neither of them is `lens.env`.** They are different files
because they are read by **different processes**, not by accident:

| Side | File | Why that file |
|---|---|---|
| **Lens** | `<talyvor-lens checkout>/.env` | `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET` is on the **CURATED** list — it is named in `docker-compose.yaml`'s `environment:`, so compose resolves it from `.env`. In `lens.env` it arrives **EMPTY** (STEP 2a-bis). |
| **BFF** | `/etc/talyvor/bff.env` | The BFF is a host systemd unit, not a container. It never reads the Lens checkout at all. |

⚠ **Do not "fix" the fact that the two checks read different paths — that is correct.**
What was wrong is that STEP 1 used to read the Lens side from `lens.env`; it now reads
`.env`, the same file STEP 4 compares against. Both steps verify the same file for the
Lens side, and `/etc/talyvor/bff.env` for the BFF side.

**Also verify:** each is ≥32 chars and is not the published placeholder
`dev-only-insecure-gateway-secret-change-me` — Track and Docs both reject that
string at boot regardless of length, because it is in git history and therefore
public (`internal/config/config.go:137` in each).

---

## STEP 2 — Lens first, and why

Lens is 7+ merges behind and must be **up, migrated and provisioning** before the
BFF starts, because the BFF calls `/v1/provision` on the very first login. Deploy
it in the other order and every login 404s.

### ⚠ 2a. Lens's compose does not pass the secret through. Fix that first.

**`LENS_PROVISION_SECRET` is absent from `talyvor-lens/docker-compose.yaml`.**
Verified: `grep -n LENS_PROVISION_SECRET docker-compose.yaml` returns nothing.

Putting it in `.env` therefore does **not** reach the container. Lens starts
cleanly, reports healthy, and — because provisioning fails *closed* — simply does
not register the route. Every login then 404s, with nothing in the Lens logs
saying why. This is the silent half-deploy this document exists to prevent, and
it is one line away.

This is a change to the **talyvor-lens** repo (not made here — that repo is
read-only for this work). Add to the `lens` service's `environment:` list,
beside the other `:-` defaults at `docker-compose.yaml:63-66`:

```yaml
      - LENS_PROVISION_SECRET=${LENS_PROVISION_SECRET:-}
```

`:-` keeps it safe by default: unset ⇒ empty ⇒ route unregistered, which is the
existing fail-closed behaviour.

**Verify before deploying:**
```sh
grep -cE '^\s*- LENS_PROVISION_SECRET=' docker-compose.yaml
# expect: 1.  0 = the secret cannot reach the container; STOP.
```

Count the **forwarding entry**, not any mention: a `grep -c LENS_PROVISION_SECRET`
also matches the comment explaining it, so it reports 1 when the line is gone.
(That exact mistake made the first version of the repo-side guard useless.)

⚠ **The same trap applies to ten more variables**, including
`LENS_CACHE_POOLABLE_ENABLED` — the global gate on pooling. Both are fixed in
talyvor-lens and held by `cmd/lens/compose_env_reach_test.go`; if you deploy a
Lens older than that fix, check each one with the pattern above.

### ⚠ 2a-bis. `lens.env` — and the trap that will bite you if you skip this section

`#377` changed the lens service from `env_file: .env` to `env_file: lens.env`, because `.env` also
holds the **Track and Docs gateway secrets** (this document's own step writes them there), which
would otherwise be loaded into the Lens process.

#### ⚠ FIRST — CORRECTION. The previous version of this step was wrong, in the direction that matters.

It said a missing `lens.env` leaves **provisioning, pooling and billing silently off**. That is
**false**, and was verified by rendering the compose project with the file absent: `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET`,
`LENS_BILLING_ENABLED`, `LENS_CACHE_POOLABLE_ENABLED` and `LENS_ECONOMY_ENABLED` **all reach the
container**, because they are named in `docker-compose.yaml`'s `environment:` list and take their
values from `.env`.

**What a missing `lens.env` actually costs** is the *long tail* — the mint caps, the embedding model,
the reservation/settlement toggles. Real, but not the headline failure the old text described.

#### ⚠⚠ SECOND — THE ACTUAL TRAP, AND IT IS A STEP, NOT A NOTE

**A variable set in BOTH `.env`'s curated list and `lens.env` arrives EMPTY.**

Compose's `environment:` **overrides** `env_file`. The curated entries are written
`- LENS_X=${LENS_X:-}`, which resolves from `.env` / the shell — and if neither defines it, that
resolves to **empty**, and the empty wins over whatever `lens.env` says. Verified in a real container;
there is no spelling of `environment:` that defers to `env_file`.

⚠ **The previous version of this step told you to put six such variables into `lens.env`**:
`LENS_PROVISION_SECRET`, `LENS_CACHE_POOLABLE_ENABLED`, `LENS_ECONOMY_ENABLED`,
`LENS_POOL_ROYALTY_MINTING_ENABLED`, `LENS_POOL_ROYALTY_SHARE`, `LENS_SHADOW_MINTS_ENABLED`. **All six
would have arrived empty.** `lens.env.example` invited the same mistake until #378 removed them.

**If you followed this document before #378, do this now:**

```sh
cd <talyvor-lens checkout>
# Anything in BOTH files is being discarded. Expect NO output.
comm -12 <(grep -oE '^[A-Z_]+' lens.env 2>/dev/null | sort -u) \
         <(grep -oE '^\s+- (LENS_[A-Z_]+)' docker-compose.yaml | grep -oE 'LENS_[A-Z_]+' | sort -u)
```

Every name it prints must be **moved out of `lens.env` and into `.env`**.

#### Which file does a variable go in?

⚠ **There is no rule to apply — the split is by mechanism, not by importance, and it does not follow
any category.** Two mint caps are curated while six others are not; secrets split 16 to 1. So this is
enumerated rather than explained, because a rule nobody can apply is worse than a list.

**These 44 go in `.env`** (they are named in `docker-compose.yaml`; putting them in `lens.env` yields
an empty value):

```
LENS_ADMIN_LXC_GRANT_ENABLED     LENS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY            LENS_API_KEY
LENS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID           LENS_AWS_REGION                   LENS_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
LENS_BILLING_CANCEL_URL          LENS_BILLING_ENABLED              LENS_BILLING_SUCCESS_URL
LENS_CACHE_POOLABLE_ENABLED      LENS_DATABASE_URL                 LENS_DB_MAX_CONNS
LENS_DB_PGBOUNCER                LENS_DISTILL_POOLABLE_ENABLED     LENS_ECONOMY_ENABLED
LENS_GOOGLE_API_KEY              LENS_GROQ_API_KEY                 LENS_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY
LENS_LOG_LEVEL                   LENS_MINT_RATE_CAP_LENS_24H       LENS_MISTRAL_API_KEY
LENS_MODEL_CATALOG_OVERRIDES     LENS_MODEL_WATCH_ENABLED          LENS_MODEL_WATCH_INTERVAL
LENS_NATS_URL                    LENS_OLLAMA_URL                   LENS_OPENAI_API_KEY
LENS_OPERATOR_ALERT_WEBHOOK_SECRET  LENS_OPERATOR_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL  LENS_PATTERN_CAPTURE_ENABLED
LENS_PATTERN_EARNING_ENABLED     LENS_PATTERN_MINING_ENABLED       LENS_POOL_ROYALTY_MINTING_ENABLED
LENS_POOL_ROYALTY_SHARE          LENS_POVI_CHALLENGE_KEY           LENS_PROVISION_SECRET
LENS_REDIS_URL                   LENS_SHADOW_MINTS_ENABLED         LENS_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
LENS_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET       LENS_TRACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET         LENS_TRACK_WEBHOOK_URL
LENS_VLLM_API_KEY                LENS_VLLM_BASE_URL
```

**Everything else goes in `lens.env`** — see `lens.env.example` in the Lens checkout for the ones
worth setting (mint caps, `LENS_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, the reservation and settlement toggles).

For any variable not on either list, this decides it mechanically:

```sh
grep -qE "^\s+- ${VAR}(=|$)" docker-compose.yaml && echo ".env" || echo "lens.env"
```

#### Create the files

```sh
# On the Lens box, in the talyvor-lens checkout, NEXT TO docker-compose.yaml.
# ⚠ $PROVISION_SECRET was exported on the WORKSTATION in STEP 1. If this shell is on the
#    Lens box it is UNSET here, and an unguarded append writes an empty value that then
#    satisfies every `grep -q` below. Refuse instead of writing a lie:
[ -n "$PROVISION_SECRET" ] || { echo "PROVISION_SECRET is empty in this shell — paste it before continuing"; }
# CURATED — these belong in .env:
[ -n "$PROVISION_SECRET" ] && { grep -q '^LENS_PROVISION_SECRET=' .env || echo "LENS_PROVISION_SECRET=$PROVISION_SECRET" >> .env; }
grep -q '^LENS_CACHE_POOLABLE_ENABLED=' .env || echo "LENS_CACHE_POOLABLE_ENABLED=true" >> .env
grep -q '^LENS_ECONOMY_ENABLED=' .env || echo "LENS_ECONOMY_ENABLED=true" >> .env
grep -q '^LENS_POOL_ROYALTY_MINTING_ENABLED=' .env || echo "LENS_POOL_ROYALTY_MINTING_ENABLED=true" >> .env
grep -q '^LENS_POOL_ROYALTY_SHARE=' .env || echo "LENS_POOL_ROYALTY_SHARE=0.5" >> .env
chmod 600 .env

# LONG TAIL — these belong in lens.env. Optional; the file itself is optional too.
cat > lens.env <<'ENV'
# EARN GATE — leave UNSET for the comped trial (a vouch is enough to earn).
# Set true before OPEN SIGNUP, so earning requires a real completed purchase.
#LENS_EARN_REQUIRE_LIVE_PURCHASE=true
ENV
chmod 600 lens.env
```

> `LENS_SHADOW_MINTS_ENABLED` is **curated**, so it goes in `.env` — and do NOT set it yet; see step 6d
> for its precondition.

#### ⚠ Verify against the PROCESS, and make the check able to FAIL

⚠ **This starts Lens before STEP 2b pulls.** That is fine for what it checks — the
environment is assembled by compose, not baked into the image — but be aware the container
it starts is the *current local* image against an *unmigrated* database, so its own logs
will be noisy and are not worth reading yet. STEP 2b pulls, migrates and recreates it.
If your checkout predates the STEP 2a compose fix, `git pull --ff-only` first or this
check reports a variable that will not exist after 2b.

```sh
docker compose up -d lens && sleep 5
# 1. The curated secret arrived:
docker compose exec -T lens printenv LENS_PROVISION_SECRET | wc -c   # expect >1
# 2. ⚠ POSITIVE CONTROL — a variable you did NOT set must be absent. If this also prints a value,
#    you are reading a stale container and check 1 proves nothing.
docker compose exec -T lens printenv LENS_NOT_A_REAL_VAR || echo "correctly absent"
```

⚠ Note that the old verify step could not detect the trap it was next to: it read
`LENS_PROVISION_SECRET`, which step 2b *also* appends to `.env`. So the `.env` copy satisfied the check
while the `lens.env` line sat inert — a green that proved the wrong thing.

### 2b. Deploy

```sh
# On the Lens box, in the talyvor-lens checkout:
git fetch origin && git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
grep -q '^LENS_PROVISION_SECRET=' .env || echo "LENS_PROVISION_SECRET=$PROVISION_SECRET" >> .env
docker compose pull
docker compose run --rm migrate       # one-shot; `restart: "no"`, NOT run on boot
docker compose up -d
```

There is **no compose profile** on the migrate service (verified: no `profiles:`
key anywhere in the file) — it is an ordinary service with `restart: "no"`, so
`run --rm migrate` is the invocation and `up -d` will also start it once. Run it
explicitly first so a migration failure stops you here rather than surfacing as a
half-started stack.

⚠ **Expect cross-tenant pooling to be OFF at this point, even with the flag set.** The
gateway holds it off until `lens poolcheck` has recorded a pool-safety attestation for
this database, which happens at STEP 6b — it cannot happen here, because `poolcheck`
runs *inside* the container this step is starting. The boot log says so explicitly:

```
POOLING FORCED OFF: cross-tenant cache pooling is enabled in config but is NOT currently justified
  reason: no pool-safety attestation has ever been recorded for this database ...
```

That is the correct state, not a fault. STEP 6b clears it **without a restart**.

**Verify the secret actually reached the process** — not just the file:
```sh
# ⚠ Do NOT pipe printenv straight into sha256sum. It never yields empty output: an
#   ABSENT variable digests to e3b0c44298fc1c14 and an EMPTY one to 01ba4719c80b6fe9 —
#   both look like a perfectly good secret digest. Tested in a real container.
v=$(docker compose exec -T lens printenv LENS_PROVISION_SECRET 2>/dev/null | tr -d '\r\n')
[ -n "$v" ] && printf '%s' "$v" | sha256sum | cut -c1-16 \
             || echo "ABSENT or EMPTY in the process — not plumbed; see STEP 2a-bis"
# expect: the same 16 chars as the BFF side in step 4.
```

**Verify — migrations match the checkout.** Derived, never hardcoded: a number
written here goes stale the next time a migration lands, and then this step fails
for the wrong reason. (It has been pinned at 107 and at 109 in this file already; both
were wrong within a day. `want` below is computed from the checkout for that reason.)
```sh
want=$(ls migrations/*.sql | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
got=$(docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U lens -d talyvor_lens -tAc \
  'SELECT count(*) FROM schema_migrations' | tr -d ' ')
echo "lens schema_migrations: got=$got want=$want"; [ "$got" = "$want" ] && echo OK || echo MISMATCH
# expect: OK.  MISMATCH ⇒ the migrate service did not run or failed — stop,
# read `docker compose logs migrate`, do not start the BFF.
```

**Verify — the provisioning route EXISTS** (this is the fail-closed one):
```sh
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST https://<lens-host>/v1/provision \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{}'
# expect: 401   ← route registered, secret required, empty body refused BEFORE parsing
# 404         ← LENS_PROVISION_SECRET is unset on Lens. Every login will fail. FIX BEFORE CONTINUING.
```
`401` is the success signal here, not an error. It proves the route is mounted
and the gate is in front of it. `404` is the failure — and it is silent from the
browser's point of view, which is why it is checked here explicitly.

**Verify — the binary is the commit you think:**
```sh
docker compose exec -T lens /lens --version 2>/dev/null || \
  docker inspect --format '{{index .Config.Labels "org.opencontainers.image.revision"}}' \
    $(docker compose ps -q lens)
# expect: the same SHA STEP 0 reported for lens
```

---

## STEP 3 — Track and Docs

**README's "Deploying Track and Docs" section is still correct** — follow it for
the databases, the compose fragment and the secret-digest comparison. Two things
to hold in mind while you do:

- **Track migrates by subcommand** (`cmd/track/main.go:132`): the
  `track-migrate` one-shot service in the compose fragment is what applies its
  schema. **Run README's verify step for it** — it is not optional; a Track that
  boots against an empty schema 500s on every call.
  ⚠ This used to say the check was *"expect a number > 0"*. It is not, and `> 0`
  would be the wrong check: README derives the expected count from
  `ls talyvor-track/migrations/*.sql` and compares for equality, because — in its
  own words — *"a number > 0 is NOT sufficient; a partial run leaves tables
  behind"* (`deploy/README.md:170-179`). That misquote pointed at a check this
  document elsewhere calls inadequate. Follow README, do not follow the old
  paraphrase.
- **Docs migrates itself on boot** (`cmd/docs/main.go:162`), fail-closed and
  advisory-locked, so a re-run is a no-op and there is no separate step. A
  migration failure is a boot failure; you will see it in `docker compose logs
  docs`, not in a silent 500 later.

**Then do 3a. README does not cover it** — it names the requirement ("a trial
user must also be a **member**") and its troubleshooting table says `403` → "add
the membership", but no step anywhere says how, because until now there was no
mechanism.

### ⚠ 3a. Docs is PER-IDENTITY. The manual seed is GONE — do not run it.

**This step used to be a hand-written `INSERT` into `workspace_members`, once per tester,
and it was load-bearing.** It is now obsolete and running it does nothing useful: it
inserted into `workspace_id = 'default'`, and **nothing asks for that id any more.**

Three merges closed the deadlock it worked around, each supplying a different half:

| merge | half |
|---|---|
| `talyvor-track bf60842` (#64) | `GET /v1/service/workspaces` — Track answers **which workspaces exist** |
| `talyvor-docs c970329` (#46) | Docs enumerates from **Track**, not from its own content |
| `talyvor-suite 030ea53` (#59) | every Docs route resolves the **session's** workspace; `DOCS_WORKSPACE_ID` removed from the BFF |

**How a new person now gets Docs access, with nothing manual in the path:**

1. They sign in. The BFF bootstraps their Track workspace (`POST /v1/bootstrap`), which
   creates the workspace **and its owner member row** in one transaction.
2. Docs' member sync enumerates Track's workspaces, sees the new one, pulls its roster, and
   upserts a `workspace_members` row for it (`source = 'track'`).
3. They open Docs. The BFF asks for `/v1/workspaces/<their Track workspace>/spaces`
   (`docsWorkspaceFor` → `trackWorkspaceFor`), Docs matches the membership, and they write.

⚠ **THE ONE CASE THAT STILL NEEDS THE SEED: rolling the BFF back below #59.** A pre-#59
binary pins `DOCS_WORKSPACE_ID` again, and a pinned workspace has no Track counterpart, so
its membership can only come from the `INSERT`. If you roll back that far, restore the seed
from git history along with the binary. Nothing else needs it — not a fresh deploy, not a
new tester, not a new workspace.

### 3a-bis. THE FIRST-VISIT WINDOW — CLOSED. What to expect, and what a `403` means now

**This section previously described a real defect with an operator workaround: a brand-new
person could get `403` from Docs for up to 15 minutes, and the mitigation was to restart Docs
after your testers had signed in. That fix has landed. Neither the wait nor the restart is
needed any more, and the `restart docs` step that used to be here is gone rather than
demoted — an unnecessary step in a runbook is read as a necessary one.**

**What happens now.** At login, immediately after Track mints the person's workspace, the BFF
asks Docs to reconcile **that one workspace's** roster from Track before the redirect
completes (`apps/bff/docs_membersync.go`, `POST {DOCS_BASE_URL}/v1/service/workspaces/{id}/member-sync`,
carrying `DOCS_GATEWAY_SECRET` as the transit proof). By the time the browser lands on the
app, the membership row exists. **A new tester writes their first Docs page on their first
visit, with no wait and no operator action.**

**The periodic sweep is still there and still matters** — it is the backstop, not the fallback
you hope never runs. Its interval went **15 minutes → 2 minutes**
(`talyvor-docs cmd/docs/main.go`, `Start(ctx, 2*time.Minute)`, with a pass at boot before the
ticker). Two independent paths reconcile the roster, so:

- a nudge that is dropped, refused, or never sent is a **delay of up to 2 minutes**, not a
  permanent `403`;
- Docs restarting, or Track being briefly unreachable at login, self-heals on the next tick.

**⚠ Both halves must be configured for the nudge to fire.** It needs `DOCS_BASE_URL` **and**
`DOCS_GATEWAY_SECRET` on the BFF, and `MEMBER_SYNC_SECRET` on Docs — with any of them missing
the nudge is skipped silently and **you are back to waiting out the sweep**, which is now 2
minutes rather than 15, so the symptom is much easier to miss than it used to be. The login
log line is the tell:

```sh
# A nudge that FAILED says so; a nudge that worked is silent (it is not an event).
docker compose logs bff --since 10m | grep -F 'docs member-sync nudge failed'
# expect: NOTHING. Any line here means the roster is arriving on the sweep, not at login.

# What the sweep itself logs, either way:
docker compose logs docs --since 5m | grep -F 'workspace reconciled'
```

**A `403` from Docs on a brand-new account is no longer expected behaviour.** If you see one,
it is now a signal rather than a known wait — check the two variables above before anything
else.

**⚠ WHAT THE SHORTER INTERVAL COSTS — it is negligible at trial scale, and here is the number
rather than the reassurance.** The interval drives `runOnce`, which is **both** the member
sweep and the page-cost sweep, so 15m → 2m multiplies **both** by 7.5× (96 → 720 passes/day).

| per pass | shape | at 20 testers / 30 pages |
|---|---|---|
| member sweep | 1 enumerate + 1 Track call per **workspace** | ~21 calls |
| cost sweep | 1 Track `GetIssue` per **linked issue**, in the one configured workspace | ~60 calls |

That is roughly **+50k Track HTTP calls/day, ~0.6 req/s averaged** — nothing for a Go service
on one box, against a saving of up to 13 minutes on every tester's first impression. Take it.

**⚠ Where it stops being negligible: the COST sweep, not the member one.** The member sweep
scales with testers (linear, small). The cost sweep scales with **pages × linked issues** and
got the 7.5× as a side effect of a change made for membership. At ~500 pages averaging two
linked issues it is ~8 req/s sustained against Track, forever, to keep a cost column fresh
that nothing reads in real time. **If Docs content grows past a few hundred pages, split the
two intervals** (member 2m, cost 15m or slower) rather than lengthening both — the member
interval is the one holding the first-visit guarantee.

### Docs now DEPENDS ON TRACK — ordering, and the symptom if you get it wrong

`docsWorkspaceFor` *is* `trackWorkspaceFor` (`apps/bff/track_tenant.go`), so the Docs
workspace id is the one Track mints at login. That makes an implicit dependency explicit:

- **Track must be configured on the BFF** (`TRACK_BASE_URL` + `TRACK_GATEWAY_SECRET`). With
  Track unset, every `/api/docs/*` route answers
  `503 {"error":"track upstream not configured on this BFF"}` — **a Docs symptom that names
  Track**, which is exactly the sort of thing that costs an hour at 2am.
- **Track must be reachable at first use.** If the bootstrap fails, Docs answers
  `503 {"error":"your Track workspace isn't ready yet …"}`. It is not recorded in the
  session, so it retries on the next request rather than sticking.
- **Ordering:** bring Track up before Docs matters less than it looks — Docs' sync tolerates
  a missing Track and retries — but the BFF must have **both** pairs configured before you
  hand out logins, or Docs is dead on arrival.

⚠ **`DOCS_WORKSPACE_ID` must be deleted from `/etc/talyvor/bff.env`.** The BFF no longer
reads it **and does not refuse it** — unlike `TRACK_WORKSPACE_ID`, which refuses to boot for
exactly this reason. A leftover line is therefore invisible and states a pinning that does
not happen. (Worth adding the same refusal in `apps/bff`; not done here, this change is
`deploy/`-only.)

Notes on Docs' membership values, unchanged: `role` is stored and resolved but **never
decides anything** in Docs today. `member_id` is free-form — Docs owns no members table.

---

## STEP 4 — the BFF environment. ⚠ ADD, DO NOT DELETE.

**Read this before editing the file.**

⚠ **This step was previously documented as ONE-WAY, requiring the env edit and the binary
swap to be atomic. That is not true, and the correction makes rollback materially cheaper.**
The old text argued *"there is no environment file that satisfies both binaries at once,
because the new one also refuses to boot if `LENS_API_KEY` is set and the old one has no
opinion about it"* — but "the old one has no opinion" is a reason you can simply **omit**
`LENS_API_KEY`, which is what makes a both-satisfying file possible. The premise argued the
opposite of its conclusion.

Read from both binaries rather than from memory (old = `0a35473^`, i.e. `84042af`):

| variable | pre-#30 binary | current binary |
|---|---|---|
| `LENS_BASE_URL` | required | required |
| `LENS_WORKSPACE_KEY` | **required** (old `main.go:89`) | **ignored** — `grep -c LENS_WORKSPACE apps/bff/main.go` = 0 |
| `LENS_WORKSPACE_ID` | **required** (old `main.go:92`) | **ignored** |
| `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET` | ignored (not read at all) | **required** — refuses to start |
| `LENS_API_KEY` | ignored (**never read** by the old binary) | **refuses to start if set** |

The old binary contains no "must not be set" logic — its only two refusals are the two
`is required` lines above. So **one file boots either binary**: keep the two workspace
variables, add `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET`, and never set `LENS_API_KEY`.

> **Rolling the BFF back is therefore a binary swap alone** — no env restore, no atomicity to
> get right under pressure. Keeping a copy (`sudo cp /etc/talyvor/bff.env
> /etc/talyvor/bff.env.pre-signup`) is still worth doing as cheap insurance, but it is no
> longer load-bearing.

Edit `/etc/talyvor/bff.env` — **an addition, not a swap:**

```diff
  LENS_WORKSPACE_KEY=tlv_ws_…      # keep: inert now, still required by the old binary
  LENS_WORKSPACE_ID=default        # keep: same reason
+ LENS_PROVISION_SECRET=<the PROVISION_SECRET from step 1 — same value Lens has>
```

Delete the two only once rolling back to a pre-#30 binary is no longer a possibility.

**Verify — the two sides match** (compares digests, never prints a secret):
```sh
# Same ABSENT-aware helper as STEP 1 — two MISSING values both hash to e3b0c44298fc1c14
# and would otherwise compare EQUAL, printing MATCH on a deploy with no secret at all.
dig16() { v=$(cat); [ -n "$v" ] || { printf 'ABSENT\n'; return; }; printf '%s' "$v" | sha256sum | cut -c1-16; }
a=$(sudo grep -oP '(?<=^LENS_PROVISION_SECRET=).*' /etc/talyvor/bff.env | dig16)   # BFF side
b=$(ssh <lens-box> "grep -oP '(?<=^LENS_PROVISION_SECRET=).*' /path/to/lens/.env" | dig16)  # Lens side
echo "bff=$a  lens=$b"
case "$a$b" in
  *ABSENT*) echo "PROVISION: NOT SET on at least one side — NOT a match; logins will fail" ;;
  *) [ "$a" = "$b" ] && echo "PROVISION: MATCH" || echo "PROVISION: MISMATCH — logins will fail" ;;
esac
# expect: PROVISION: MATCH.  The two paths differ ON PURPOSE — see STEP 1's settlement box.
```

**Verify — `LENS_API_KEY` is absent:**
```sh
sudo grep -c '^LENS_API_KEY=' /etc/talyvor/bff.env
# expect exactly: 0    (any other number = the BFF will refuse to boot)
```

---

## STEP 5 — ship the BFF and preflight it

Build and ship per README §2 and §3b (unchanged). Then use README §5's preflight
boot — it is the step that catches an env mistake **before** systemd and Caddy
are involved, and it is more valuable now than it was, because three of the
failure modes above are boot refusals with named causes.

**Verify — preflight names no missing variable:**
```sh
sudo -u talyvor env $(sudo cat /etc/talyvor/bff.env | grep -v '^#' | xargs) \
  /opt/talyvor/bin/bff 2>&1 | head -5
# expect: a listening line, NOT "LENS_PROVISION_SECRET is required" and
#         NOT "LENS_API_KEY must not be set on the BFF"
```

Then `systemctl restart talyvor-bff` per README §6.

---

## STEP 6 — verification. ⚠ YOUR EXISTING CANARY NO LONGER PROVES WHAT IT DID.

### The decision you asked for: `default`, and the key `tlv_ws_27f4…`

**The key still works. The canary that uses it no longer verifies the suite.**
Both halves matter, and they were verified from source rather than reasoned about:

- **Against Lens directly — unchanged.** Nothing in the signup work touched
  Lens's key validation: `ValidateAPIKey` still resolves a `tlv_` key to its own
  workspace row (`internal/auth/manager.go:283-289`), no migration since 0104
  touches `api_keys` (checked to 0110; re-check with
  `grep -l api_keys migrations/*.sql` if you need it current), and `default` is still registered unconditionally at every
  Lens boot (`cmd/lens/main.go:349`). Your key authenticates, resolves to
  `default`, and its balance and ledger are exactly where you left them.
- **Through the BFF — it is not used at all any more.** The BFF no longer holds
  a configured workspace key; every BFF→Lens request now carries the *signed-in
  person's* session JWT. So a request through the suite lands in **that person's
  own workspace**, never in `default`.

So the old canary — "hit the app, watch `default`'s ledger move" — now proves
nothing about the suite: the suite never touches `default`. Worse, it would look
like a *pass* while per-user provisioning was completely broken.

**Split the verification in two.** Each proves a different thing, and you need
both:

**6a. Lens is alive and settling money** — unchanged, keep using your key:
```sh
curl -s https://<lens-host>/v1/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer tlv_ws_27f4…" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001","max_tokens":16,
       "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"deploy canary"}]}' -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n'
# expect: 200

docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U lens -d talyvor_lens -tAc \
  "SELECT status FROM lxc_reservations ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1"
# expect: settled     ← the go/no-go. 'held' or no row means the money path is broken.
```

⚠ **6a ALONE IS NOT A PASS, and this is proven rather than cautionary.** The BFF no
longer touches `default` at all — every request carries the signed-in person's own
token. So 6a can be fully green while provisioning is completely broken: it exercises
Lens directly with your own key and never goes near the code path the suite uses.
**Treat 6a and 6b as one gate; neither result means anything without the other.**

```sh
# The combined gate. Both halves, one verdict — so a green 6a cannot be mistaken
# for a deploy that works.
LENS_OK=$(docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U lens -d talyvor_lens -tAc \
  "SELECT status FROM lxc_reservations ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1" | tr -d ' ')
WS_N=$(docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U lens -d talyvor_lens -tAc \
  "SELECT count(*) FROM workspaces WHERE id LIKE 'u%'" | tr -d ' ')
echo "lens settles: $LENS_OK    derived workspaces: $WS_N"
[ "$LENS_OK" = "settled" ] && [ "$WS_N" -ge 1 ] && echo "DEPLOY OK" || echo "NOT OK — do not proceed"
# expect: DEPLOY OK.  'settled' with 0 workspaces = Lens is fine and signup is broken.
```

**6b. Per-user provisioning works** — this is the new one, and it is the one
that proves the *suite* deploy:
```sh
# Sign in at https://app.talyvor.com as a trial user, then:
curl -s https://app.talyvor.com/auth/me -b <your session cookie> | jq .
# expect: "authenticated": true
#         "workspace_id": "u…"        ← a DERIVED id, 27 chars, starts with u
#         NOT "default", NOT empty
```
```sh
# And on the Lens box — the workspace really exists, and it is not 'default':
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U lens -d talyvor_lens -tAc \
  "SELECT id, cache_poolable FROM workspaces WHERE id LIKE 'u%' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3"
# expect: one row per person who has signed in, each id starting 'u',
#         cache_poolable = f   ← created DECLINED; consent is opt-in
```

**Two people, two workspaces** — the property the whole change exists for:
```sh
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U lens -d talyvor_lens -tAc \
  "SELECT count(DISTINCT id) FROM workspaces WHERE id LIKE 'u%'"
# expect: equal to the number of distinct people who have signed in.
#         1 when two people have signed in = provisioning is collapsing them. STOP.
```

---

## STEP 6b — `lens poolcheck`, before you open the pooling gate

⚠ **Run this on the Lens box after deploy, and after ANY change to
`LENS_EMBEDDING_MODEL` or `LENS_SEMANTIC_THRESHOLD`.**

Cross-tenant pooling serves one workspace's cached answer to another when two prompts
are similar enough. `poolcheck` embeds a corpus of *"same fixed preamble, unrelated
content"* prompts through **the configured embedder** and exits non-zero if any
unrelated pair reaches `LENS_SEMANTIC_THRESHOLD` — i.e. if this configuration could
serve one company's response to another.

```sh
docker compose exec -T lens /lens poolcheck
# prints: embedding model / threshold / pooling enabled, then per-pair scores
# exit 0 = margin holds.  exit 1 = "pool-safety check FAILED: unrelated prompts reach
#                                   the pooling threshold" — DO NOT open gate 1.
```

### ⚠ What running it actually changes — and why no restart is needed

On success `poolcheck` **records an attestation**: a row naming the embedding model and
threshold it just measured safe. The gateway re-reads that row **every 30 seconds** and
opens or closes cross-tenant pooling to match. So:

```
STEP 2b  docker compose up -d      → no attestation yet → pooling FORCED OFF
STEP 6b  lens poolcheck            → passes, records the attestation
         ...within ~30s            → "POOLING ENABLED" in the gateway log. No restart.
```

⚠ **Do not restart the gateway to "apply" it.** You do not need to, and a restart here
buys nothing: the gateway is already watching. Wait for the log line below, or check
gate 1b in STEP 6c.

**Confirm it actually opened** — the gateway log is the authority:

```sh
# ⚠ NO --since. The gateway logs this line only when the decision CHANGES (steady state is
# deliberately silent, or a 30s ticker would flood the log). A time-windowed grep therefore
# returns NOTHING once things have settled, and empty output is not a verdict. The LAST such
# line is the current state.
docker compose logs lens 2>&1 | grep -E 'POOLING (ENABLED|FORCED OFF)' | tail -1
# want: POOLING ENABLED: the live embedding configuration matches the last passing poolcheck
# ⚠ NO OUTPUT AT ALL ⇒ this proved nothing. Either the container was recreated (logs start
#   fresh) or pooling is off in config so the gate never ran. Check gate 1a first, then
#   `docker compose restart lens` and read again — boot always emits one.
```

If it still says `FORCED OFF` after 30 seconds, the `reason` field on that line names the
cause exactly — a model or threshold that does not match what was attested, or a database
the gateway cannot read. It is never a bare "off".

⚠ **The attestation is bound to the configuration — but only the DATABASE side is re-read.**
The refresh compares the attested row against the model and threshold **this process booted
with**. Those come from the environment and cannot change while it runs (there is no config
reload in Lens), so:

- **Editing `LENS_EMBEDDING_MODEL` or `LENS_SEMANTIC_THRESHOLD` changes nothing until the
  gateway restarts.** Do not expect the 30-second refresh to notice an env edit — it is not
  watching the environment, and reading it as a live guard on config changes is the one
  wrong conclusion to draw from this section. On the next restart the comparison runs
  against the new values and pooling closes then, naming what changed.
- **What the refresh does catch on its own** is the row moving underneath a running
  gateway — `poolcheck` re-run with a different configuration, or against a restored
  database. That is the shared-mutable-state case, and it is why re-reading exists.

Direction matters and is deliberate: **lowering** the threshold voids the attestation
(it widens what counts as a match beyond what was measured), while **raising** it does
**not** — a stricter setting is already covered by a measurement that passed at a looser
one, and forcing pooling off on the conservative change would be a false alarm
(`internal/poolsafety/attestation.go`, `MatchesLive`).

**Why it is a deploy step and not a CI gate:** it costs real embedding calls and needs
a live `LENS_OPENAI_API_KEY`, and a gateway restart is the wrong moment to discover a
config problem *and* pay for it on every replica.

**Why it is not optional:** the margin depends on which embedder is configured. On the
real model, unrelated pairs score **0.6534** against a **0.92** threshold — a 0.27
margin. An earlier 0.985 alarm came from a local stand-in with a compressed range and
is not real. But `text-embedding-ada-002` scores **0.81**, which eats more than half
the margin — so the safety of this depends on a variable someone can change without
touching any code. This is the only thing standing between "today's model happens to be
safe" and "we would notice if it stopped being".

---

## STEP 6c — the three pooling gates, in one query

⚠ **Cross-tenant pooling has THREE gates and all three must be satisfied before a
single royalty can mint.** Setting one is the natural thing to do and is not
enough; gate 1 is now self-reporting (below) but gates 2 and 3 are not. Run the royalty
test with one still closed and you see no mint, with no way to tell *not implemented*
from *not switched on*. Check all three at once, before you conclude anything.

| # | Gate | Where it lives | Shut by default? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `LENS_CACHE_POOLABLE_ENABLED` **AND** a current pool-safety attestation | Lens process env (see STEP 2a) **and** the `pool_safety_attestation` row written by STEP 6b | **yes**, both halves |
| 2 | `workspaces.cache_poolable` | per workspace, in the Lens database | no — new workspaces are created ON |
| 3 | `earn_verified` **on both sides** | derived: an admin vouch **or** a completed `lxc_purchases` row | **yes** for a comped trial |

Gate 3 is the one that surprises: it is not a flag you set, it is
`earn_verified = true` **OR** a completed real-money purchase
(`internal/earnverify/verify.go`). A comped trial user satisfies neither, so a
trial with no payments mints nothing **even with gates 1 and 2 open** — by
design, it is the Sybil floor.

```sh
# On the Lens box. Prints all three gates for the pair you are testing.
# Replace the two ids with the contributor and requester workspaces.
CONTRIB=u...   # whose cached answer is reused
REQUESTER=u... # who reuses it

echo "GATE 1a (global flag, as the PROCESS sees it — not as .env claims):"
# ⚠ Compare the VALUE. `printenv VAR` exits 0 and prints a blank line when the variable is
# set-but-empty, so `printenv ... || echo SHUT` cannot see the one outcome the STEP 2a-bis
# trap produces (curated name, no value ⇒ empty). Tested: exit 0, empty output.
v=$(docker compose exec -T lens printenv LENS_CACHE_POOLABLE_ENABLED 2>/dev/null | tr -d '\r\n')
case "$v" in
  true) echo "  true  ⇒ OPEN" ;;
  "")   echo "  <EMPTY or ABSENT>  ⇒ SHUT — see STEP 2a-bis: a curated name in lens.env arrives empty" ;;
  *)    echo "  '$v'  ⇒ SHUT" ;;
esac

echo "GATE 1b (pool-safety attestation — the flag alone is NOT enough):"
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U lens -d talyvor_lens -tAc "
SELECT embedding_model, threshold, worst_score, checked_at
FROM pool_safety_attestation;"
# empty  ⇒ SHUT: poolcheck has never passed here. Run STEP 6b.
# a row  ⇒ it must MATCH the live config, or the gateway still holds pooling off:
docker compose exec -T lens printenv LENS_EMBEDDING_MODEL LENS_SEMANTIC_THRESHOLD

echo "GATE 1b, the authoritative read — what the PROCESS decided:"
# ⚠ No --since: this line is emitted only on a CHANGE, so any time window goes empty once
# the deploy has settled and empty would read as "fine". The last line is the live state.
docker compose logs lens 2>&1 | grep -E 'POOLING (ENABLED|FORCED OFF)' | tail -1 \
  || true
# want: POOLING ENABLED: ...
# NO OUTPUT ⇒ proved nothing (recreated container, or pooling off in config). Not a pass.
# FORCED OFF carries a "reason" naming the cause exactly. It is never a bare "off".

echo "GATE 2+3 (per workspace):"
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U lens -d talyvor_lens -tAc "
SELECT w.id,
       w.cache_poolable                                   AS gate2_poolable,
       (w.earn_verified
        OR EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM lxc_purchases p
                   WHERE p.workspace_id = w.id
                     AND p.status = 'completed' AND p.lxc_amount > 0)) AS gate3_may_earn
FROM workspaces w WHERE w.id IN ('$CONTRIB','$REQUESTER');"
```

**Expect, for a royalty to be able to fire:**

```
GATE 1: true
GATE 2+3:
  u<contributor>|t|t
  u<requester>  |t|t
```

Read it as: **any `f`, or an empty gate 1, and no royalty will mint** — and that
is a configuration state, not a bug. Specifically:

- **gate 1a empty** → the flag never reached the process. Check STEP 2a: it must be
  in the lens service's `environment:`, not only in `.env`. `printenv` above is the
  authority; the file is not.
- **gate 1b `POOLING FORCED OFF`** → the flag reached the process and the process is not
  honouring it, because the live embedding configuration is not the one that passed
  `poolcheck`. The `reason` on that log line names the cause. Re-run STEP 6b; pooling
  reopens within 30 seconds with no restart. ⚠ Note that `printenv` says `true` in this
  state — the env var is set and ineffective, which is exactly why gate 1a alone is not
  an answer.

  If you have the admin key, `GET /v1/admin/economy/flags` reports the same thing in one
  place: `CachePoolableEnabled` comes back with `"state":"forced_off_at_runtime"`, the
  configured value it is overriding, and a `note` carrying the reason. That endpoint is
  admin-gated and this runbook never establishes an admin key, so the log above is the
  check to use here.
- **gate 2 `f`** → that workspace declined at signup, or was set off by hand. It is
  consent; do not flip it in SQL on a customer's behalf.
- **gate 3 `f`** → no payment and no vouch. On a comped trial this is expected and
  correct. To exercise the royalty path deliberately, use the admin vouch
  (`earn_verified`) rather than faking a purchase row — a fabricated
  `lxc_purchases` row is money that was never collected.

> **Do not conclude "royalties are broken" until this query shows `true / t / t`
> on both sides.** Setting `default`'s `cache_poolable` by hand satisfies gate 2
> for one workspace and nothing else — it is one of three, and the other two are
> shut by default.

---

## STEP 6d — shadow mints. ⚠ PRECONDITION: the notice must already be SERVING.

`LENS_SHADOW_MINTS_ENABLED` records what six unproven earning mechanisms *would*
have paid, without crediting it. Turning it on while testers have not been told is
running unpaid contribution without having said so.

**The precondition is not "the suite is deployed", it is "the bundle being served
contains the notice".** A built-but-not-shipped bundle passes the first and fails
the second.

### The check — a version comparison, with the content grep as fallback

Suite `619e27a` (#39) stamps the commit into every bundle, so this is now a version
question rather than a content probe. **Both checks are here on purpose** — see the
transition note below for which one applies to you.

**1. What commit is the SERVED bundle?**

```sh
# On the app host. Either works; the first also reports the BFF for comparison.
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/version | jq -r '.bundle.commit // "UNSTAMPED"'
jq -r '.commit // "UNSTAMPED"' /opt/talyvor/web-dist/version.json
```

⚠ **Read `.bundle.commit`, NOT `.commit`.** `.commit` is the **BFF's** version and says
nothing about whether a web copy is serving. The two are shipped by separate commands
and can differ; only the bundle's commit answers "can a tester see this?". Reading the
wrong field passes this precondition on the strength of a *backend* deploy.

**2. Is the notice in that commit?** Ancestry, in a checkout of `talyvor-suite`:

```sh
NOTICE=b41ea4d          # the commit that added the tester notice (#34)
DEPLOYED=$(curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/version | jq -r '.bundle.commit')
git merge-base --is-ancestor "$NOTICE" "${DEPLOYED%-dirty}" \
  && echo "notice IS in the served bundle" \
  || echo "notice is NOT — do not set LENS_SHADOW_MINTS_ENABLED"
```

Controlled both ways before being written here: `f010599` (the commit immediately
before the notice) reports **ABSENT**; `b41ea4d` and everything after report PRESENT.
`${DEPLOYED%-dirty}` strips the marker a workstation build adds when its tree had
uncommitted changes — if you see `-dirty`, the deployed bundle does not correspond to
any pushed commit and the ancestry answer is approximate.

Why this beats the grep: it generalises to every future precondition instead of needing
a new string each time, it survives a copy reword, and it cannot pass because the string
happens to appear somewhere unrelated.

### ⚠ THE TRANSITION — the grep stays for now

**`version.json` exists only in bundles built from #39 onward, so the first
script-built bundle is the one being deployed tonight.** Until one is actually serving,
the version check has nothing to read and reports `UNSTAMPED` / `readable: false`.

- **Bundle predates #39** (or the check says `UNSTAMPED`) → use the grep below. It is
  the only check available.
- **Bundle built with `scripts/build-release.sh`** → use the version comparison above,
  and `.bundle.commit` also answers "did my deploy land?" in the same request.

Do not delete the grep in the same change that adds the version check.

```sh
# FALLBACK. On the app host. Greps the bundle that is actually being served.
grep -l 'Not every kind of contribution earns LENS' /opt/talyvor/web-dist/assets/*.js
# expect: one filename.  NO OUTPUT ⇒ the served bundle predates the notice —
# DO NOT set LENS_SHADOW_MINTS_ENABLED. Ship the web bundle first.
```
*(Verified against a real `pnpm build` of suite `2d239d7`: the string survives
minification and appears exactly once.)*

### Verifying it: the status code is now honest, and the JSON check is still the better one

`GET /version.json` on a bundle that predates #39 returns **HTTP 404**. It did not
always: `/version.json` used to leave by the SPA fallback and answer **200 with HTML**,
so `curl -f $APP/version.json` succeeded against a bundle carrying no version at all —
absence read as success, a green check sitting next to the exact condition it was meant
to detect. `/version.json` and `/assets/…` are now excluded from the fallback (a path the
build owns is answered by the build or by 404), measured:

```
GET /version.json on a bundle with NO version.json → 404, content-type: text/plain
GET /version.json on a bundle that HAS one         → 200, content-type: application/json
```

**Still require the response to parse as JSON.** The status code is now sound, but the
JSON check proves the stronger thing — that the file is a version payload and not merely
present — and it is the same command whether or not the origin in front of the BFF (a
proxy, a CDN, a static host) has a fallback of its own:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/version.json | jq -e '.commit' >/dev/null \
  && echo "bundle reports a commit" \
  || echo "NO VERSION — pre-#39 bundle, or not the app you think. Use the grep."
```

⚠ A CLIENT ROUTE IS STILL NOT VERIFIABLE BY STATUS — `/ledger` and `/billing/success`
answer 200 whether or not the router draws them, because they are not files. See
**Reading verification output** at the top of this document.

Only once one of the two checks above passes:
```sh
# add LENS_SHADOW_MINTS_ENABLED=true to .env — it is CURATED (STEP 2a-bis), so lens.env
# would deliver it EMPTY. Then:
docker compose up -d lens
# Compare the VALUE: printenv prints a blank line and exits 0 for a set-but-empty var.
[ "$(docker compose exec -T lens printenv LENS_SHADOW_MINTS_ENABLED 2>/dev/null | tr -d '\r\n')" = true ] \
  && echo "shadow mints: ON" || echo "shadow mints: NOT true — check .env (curated), not lens.env"
```

---

## STEP 7 — billing. ⚠ THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING.

Enabling billing *before* proving the webhook works charges a customer's card with
nothing recorded on our side: Stripe takes the money, the webhook fails, and no LXC
is credited. The sequence below never has money in flight before the recording path
is proven.

**1. Put all five values in `.env` with billing still OFF.** ⚠ **All five are CURATED** —
they appear in `docker-compose.yaml`'s `environment:` list (STEP 2a-bis), so putting them in
`lens.env` delivers them **empty** and Stripe calls fail with a blank key:
```sh
LENS_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
LENS_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
LENS_BILLING_SUCCESS_URL=https://app.talyvor.com/billing/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
LENS_BILLING_CANCEL_URL=https://app.talyvor.com/billing/cancel
LENS_BILLING_ENABLED=false        # ← still false
```

**2. Restart, and confirm billing is genuinely off:**
```sh
docker compose up -d lens
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://<lens-host>/v1/billing/webhook -X POST -d '{}'
# expect: 400  ← the route is registered and refused an unsigned body.
# 404 ⇒ the webhook route is NOT mounted; fix that before going further.
```

**3. Prove the webhook records, using Stripe's own replay — still with billing off:**
```sh
# ⚠ CAPTURE THE BASELINE FIRST. "a number that INCREASED" cannot be evaluated without
#   one, and a check that cannot be evaluated cannot fail.
count() { docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U lens -d talyvor_lens -tAc \
  "SELECT count(*) FROM lxc_purchases WHERE status='completed'" | tr -d ' \r'; }
before=$(count); echo "before=$before"

stripe trigger checkout.session.completed --forward-to https://<lens-host>/v1/billing/webhook
# expect: 200 from the endpoint, and:

after=$(count); echo "after=$after"
[ -n "$before" ] && [ -n "$after" ] && [ "$after" -eq $((before + 1)) ] \
  && echo "WEBHOOK RECORDS: OK" \
  || echo "WEBHOOK DID NOT RECORD (before=$before after=$after) — signature or handler is wrong"
# expect: WEBHOOK RECORDS: OK. Anything else ⇒ stop here, with no real card involved.
# An empty before/after means psql itself failed — also not a pass.
```

**4. Only now enable:**
```sh
# LENS_BILLING_ENABLED=true in .env  (curated — NOT lens.env)
docker compose up -d lens
[ "$(docker compose exec -T lens printenv LENS_BILLING_ENABLED 2>/dev/null | tr -d '\r\n')" = true ] \
  && echo "billing: ON" || echo "billing: NOT true — check .env (curated), not lens.env"
```

---

## ⚠ Steps that cannot be fully verified — and what to watch instead

Five steps were named as reading like verification without being it. Four are now
fixed; the fifth cannot be fixed on a single box, and says so.

| Step | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `docker compose ps` everywhere | A green status read as a deploy verdict | **Fixed by statement, once**, at the top: *status is not capability*. Every capability has its own exercising check. |
| Secret matching | Mismatch surfaced as a 401/404 three steps later | **Fixed twice.** STEP 1 compares all three digests at the moment you set them — and the first version of that fix printed MATCH when BOTH sides were missing, because two absent values hash alike. It reports `ABSENT` distinctly now. |
| Lens canary alone | Passed while provisioning was broken | **Fixed**: 6a and 6b are one combined gate printing a single `DEPLOY OK`; `settled` with zero derived workspaces now reads as NOT OK. |
| Caddy front door | Proved the door serves, not *which* binary is behind it | **Fixed** below. |
| Track/Docs delegation | Two documents that can drift | **Partly fixed** below — and the residue is stated. |

### Which binary is behind Caddy — fixed

The `curl` checks in README §7 prove the front door serves. They do not prove the BFF
behind it is the build you just shipped; a failed `scp` or a `systemctl` that never
restarted leaves the old binary answering, healthily.

```sh
# On your workstation, after STEP 5 recorded the checksum:
LOCAL=$(shasum -a 256 bff-linux-amd64 | cut -d' ' -f1)
REMOTE=$(ssh <app-box> 'shasum -a 256 /opt/talyvor/bin/bff' | cut -d' ' -f1)
RUNNING=$(ssh <app-box> 'shasum -a 256 /proc/$(pgrep -f /opt/talyvor/bin/bff | head -1)/exe' | cut -d' ' -f1)
echo "built  =$LOCAL"; echo "on disk=$REMOTE"; echo "RUNNING=$RUNNING"
# expect: all three IDENTICAL.
# on-disk matches but RUNNING differs ⇒ the file was replaced and the service never
# restarted — the exact case a healthy front door hides.
```

`/proc/<pid>/exe` is the authority: it is the image the kernel actually loaded, so it
cannot be fooled by a file that was copied over after the process started.

### Track/Docs delegation — partly fixed, residue stated

README's Track/Docs section is now the **single authority** for their mechanics, and
its migration checks are count-derived rather than "> 0". STEP 3 here no longer
restates any check — it points, so there is one place to change. (One exception,
deliberate: STEP 3 characterises README's Track check well enough to warn that an
earlier paraphrase of it — "expect a number > 0" — was wrong and weaker. That is a
correction to a misquote, not a second copy of the check.)

**What is not fixed:** two files can still disagree in *prose*. Nothing enforces that
STEP 3's summary stays true to README. **What to watch:** if the two ever conflict,
README wins for Track/Docs mechanics, and this line is your tie-breaker. A test could
enforce it, but a test that greps documentation for agreement is the kind of guard
that passes on its own comment — see `cmd/lens/compose_env_reach_test.go` in
talyvor-lens for how that failed in practice.

### Genuinely unverifiable on one box

- **Certificate renewal.** Caddy auto-renews from its `caddy_data` volume. Nothing in
  a deploy proves a renewal 60 days out will succeed. **Watch instead:**
  `curl -sI https://app.talyvor.com | grep -i strict-transport` today, and set a
  calendar reminder to re-check before expiry. There is no deploy-time check for a
  future event, and pretending otherwise would be the failure this document is about.
- **The IdP staying reachable.** Google is in the login path. A deploy-time login proves
  today. **Watch instead:** the BFF logs `bff: session created for sub=…` on every
  success; its absence over a period is the signal.

## ⚠ EXPECTED NOISE — read this BEFORE you read the logs

Whoever opens the logs first will find these and reasonably conclude the deploy is
broken. Most of them are not. This section exists so a known-harmless line does not
trigger the rollback of a working deploy — **and so that anything NOT listed here is
treated as real.** A warning that repeats forever and means nothing is how people
learn to stop reading logs, and the next warning will be a real one.

⚠ **THE SET IS CLOSED, AND THAT IS ONLY TRUE IF ADDING TO IT COSTS SOMETHING.** A line
gets a row here by someone establishing *why* it is emitted and *why* it is harmless —
ideally with the code reference, as the rows below have. "I have seen it before and
nothing broke" is not a reason, and a table that grows that way stops meaning anything:
it becomes a list of things nobody investigated, which is worse than no list, because it
launders an unexamined line into an expected one.

**One row below is deliberately not harmless.** A regression can wear the same shape
as expected noise, so the table says which is which rather than implying that
everything listed is safe.

| What you will see | Where | Harmless? | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `member sync — workspace reconciled` (INFO), one per Track workspace, every 2 min, plus one on demand at each new person's login | `docker compose logs docs` | **Yes — but read `pruned`** | Normal output now the sync is ON (STEP 3a). Detail below. |
| ⚠ **NO `member sync` lines at all** | `docker compose logs docs` | **NO — fix it** | The sync is wired as of 2026-07-27, so silence means it is NOT running: `MEMBER_SYNC_SECRET` or `DOCS_TRACK_URL` missing from the fragment. `SyncMembers` returns **silently** in that state — no error, no warning. Detail below. |
| `environment hygiene: this container holds CREDENTIAL-SHAPED variables that are not Lens's` (ERROR), naming e.g. `TRACK_GATEWAY_AUTH_SECRET` / `DOCS_GATEWAY_AUTH_SECRET` | `docker compose logs lens` | **NO — fix it** | Lens is being handed another service's secrets. It means `env_file:` is forwarding the project `.env` instead of `lens.env`, i.e. the leak lens#377/#378 closed has returned. A Lens crash dump would carry Track's and Docs's gateway secrets. Fires only when the unexpected variable name ends in `SECRET`/`KEY`/`TOKEN`/`PASSWORD`/`CREDENTIALS` (`cmd/lens/env_hygiene.go:98`). |
| `modelwatch: NO ALERT SINK CONFIGURED` (ERROR) at Lens boot | `docker compose logs lens` | **Yes** | `LENS_OPERATOR_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` is unset, which is currently correct — nothing accepts that payload yet. Logged at ERROR deliberately so the gap stays visible (`internal/modelwatch/modelwatch.go:197`). Expect it once per boot. |
| Lens WARN: *"the embedding model has been changed while cross-tenant pooling is ENABLED … Run `lens poolcheck`"* | `docker compose logs lens` | **Only if you meant it** | Fires only when `LENS_EMBEDDING_MODEL` differs from the default **and** pooling is on (`cmd/lens/env_hygiene.go:127`). It does not judge the model and does not block boot — but the cross-tenant margin is a property of the embedder, so run `lens poolcheck` before trusting it. If you did not change the model, something else did. |

The Docs member-sync silence is what this deploy introduces, so it gets the detail:

### `docs` — the member-sync lines, and which of them are faults

The sync was OFF until 2026-07-27 and this section said so. It is now wired (STEP 3a), so
these lines are expected and their **absence** is the fault. Taken from
`talyvor-docs internal/trackintegration/{syncer,enumerate}.go` rather than from a previous
deploy's memory.

**Normal — one per Track workspace, at boot and every 2 minutes (STEP 3a-bis), plus one extra
for a single workspace each time a new person logs in — that one is the login-time nudge:**

```json
{"level":"INFO","msg":"trackintegration: member sync — workspace reconciled",
 "workspace_id":"<a Track workspace id>","upserted":1,"pruned":0}
```

⚠ **Read `pruned`.** `0` is the steady state. Non-zero means rows were deleted because
Track's roster no longer lists them — correct behaviour when someone leaves, and a surprise
on a fresh deploy. Prune is scoped `source = 'track'`; the hand-seeded rows STEP 3a used to
create are `source = 'seed'` and are never counted here — they are also obsolete now, so on
a new deploy there are none.

⚠ **Expect one line per signed-in person**, because Track mints a workspace per identity and
Docs syncs each. A deployment with three testers reconciles three workspaces every pass. A
workspace id you do not recognise is not automatically wrong — it is somebody's, and the ids
are opaque.

⚠ **A person who just signed in for the first time gets their OWN line, out of step with the
sweep** — that is the login-time nudge (STEP 3a-bis) reconciling their one workspace, and it is
why they no longer have to wait for a pass. It carries a single `workspace_id` rather than the
full set. If a new person appears only on the next sweep instead, the nudge is not firing: see
the `DOCS_BASE_URL` / `DOCS_GATEWAY_SECRET` check in STEP 3a-bis.

**Harmless and self-healing:**

```json
{"level":"WARN","msg":"trackintegration: member sync — pull failed, skipping workspace",
 "workspace_id":"…","err":"…"}
```

One workspace's roster pull failed; that workspace is **skipped**, its existing roster left
intact rather than pruned. A handful during a Track restart is normal. The same line
repeating for **every** workspace, forever, is a real fault — a wrong
`DOCS_TRACK_MEMBER_SYNC_SECRET` shows up here as `401 Unauthorized`.

**Degraded, and it names itself:**

```json
{"level":"WARN","msg":"trackintegration: workspace enumeration — Track unreachable, falling back to content-derived",
 "err":"…","effect":"workspaces with no content yet are not synced this cycle; existing rosters are unaffected"}
```

Track could not answer "which workspaces exist", so Docs fell back to its own content. **Not
dangerous** — the fallback can only shorten the list, and a workspace that is not enumerated
is not pruned. But a brand-new tenant gets no roster while this persists, which is the
deadlock the fix exists to prevent. If it repeats, fix Track's reachability.

**A real fault:**

```json
{"level":"WARN","msg":"trackintegration: member sync — enumerate workspaces","err":"…"}
```

**Both** Track and the content fallback failed, so the cycle did nothing. Deliberately an
error rather than an empty list — an empty list would have read as a clean run forever.

```json
{"level":"WARN","msg":"trackintegration: member sync — reconcile failed","workspace_id":"…","err":"…"}
```

The pull succeeded and the database write did not. Check Postgres.

## Rollback matrix

| Step | Reversible? | How |
|---|---|---|
| STEP 0 image preflight | n/a | Nothing changed. |
| STEP 2 Lens image | **Yes, if nothing schema-breaking landed since your target** | `docker compose` pinned to the previous `:<sha>`, `up -d`. Safe when the migrations added **between that image and now** are additive, so the old binary still finds the columns and tables it queries. ⚠ **Derive that from your rollback target — do not trust a written range**; the one that used to be here (`0104–0107`) was three migrations stale within hours. See "Checking the rollback invariant" below. |
| STEP 2 Lens **migrations** | **NO** | Forward-only; there are no down-migrations. This is fine *because* they are additive — but you cannot un-apply them. |
| STEP 3 Track image | **Yes** | Previous `:<sha>`. Verified: **0 destructive statements** across all Track migrations — I checked rather than assuming Lens's property transfers. |
| STEP 3 Docs image | **Yes** | Previous `:<sha>`. Verified: **0 destructive statements**. Note Docs migrates on boot, so an older image simply finds its schema already ahead — additive, so it runs. |
| STEP 3 Track/Docs **databases** | **NO** | Forward-only, as above. Dropping the databases is the only "undo" and it destroys data. |
| **STEP 4 BFF environment** | **Yes** — it is an ADD, not a swap | Nothing to undo: the old variables were never deleted, and the old binary ignores `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET`. See below. |
| STEP 5 BFF binary | **Yes — binary swap alone** | Restore `/opt/talyvor/bin/bff` and restart. The env file needs no change, because step 4 kept the values the old binary requires. |
| STEP 7 Caddy | Yes | README's placeholder rollback, unchanged. |

### ⚠ Checking the rollback invariant — derived from YOUR target, not from a written range

The row above used to read *"migrations 0104–0107 are all additive"*. Lens was at **110** within
hours, so the audited range was three short — **in the row you consult while deciding whether to roll
back under pressure.** A number in a safety claim expires silently.

⚠ **And the obvious replacement is false.** "Every Lens migration is additive" is not true: `0034`
renames a table for partitioning and `0082`/`0083` change column types. Those do not matter for a
one-release rollback — they are far behind any image you would pin — which is exactly why the
question is **"what landed since my target"**, not "is the whole history additive".

```sh
# On the Lens box, in the talyvor-lens checkout. TARGET = the image tag you would roll back to.
TARGET=<the previous :sha>
since=$(git diff --name-only "$TARGET"..HEAD -- migrations/ | grep '\.sql$')

if [ -z "$since" ]; then
  echo "NO migrations landed since $TARGET — image rollback is schema-safe."
else
  echo "$(printf '%s\n' "$since" | wc -l | tr -d ' ') migration(s) landed since $TARGET:"
  printf '   %s\n' $since
  echo "--- statements that could break an older binary (empty = none) ---"
  grep -nHiE '(DROP[[:space:]]+TABLE|DROP[[:space:]]+COLUMN|ALTER[[:space:]]+COLUMN[^,;]*TYPE|RENAME[[:space:]]+TO|RENAME[[:space:]]+COLUMN)' $since || true
  echo "--- end. Any line above: READ IT before rolling back. ---"
fi
```

**Read the output; it is not a verdict.** The grep can match the same words inside a comment, so a hit
means *"a human looks at this file"*, not *"rollback is unsafe"*. `DROP INDEX`, `DROP VIEW … CREATE OR
REPLACE` and `DROP TRIGGER … CREATE` are deliberately **not** matched — an older binary is unaffected
by a missing index or a recreated view, and flagging them produced a **false "unsafe" on 16 of 110
files**, which would have blocked a legitimate rollback at the worst moment.

**What it prints in each failure state, and whether that is distinguishable from a pass:**

| state | prints | mistakable for a pass? |
|---|---|---|
| nothing landed since target | `NO migrations landed since <target>` | — (the pass, and it names the target) |
| migrations landed, none breaking | the file list, then an empty statement section | No — the file list is always printed, so silence never stands alone |
| a breaking statement | `file:line:` with the statement | No |
| `$TARGET` unset or wrong | `git diff` errors to stderr; `since` is empty ⇒ **prints the pass line naming an empty target** | ⚠ **YES — this is the one to watch.** Confirm the target in the message is the SHA you meant. |

⚠ That last row is the residual, and it is stated rather than hidden: a mistyped `TARGET` yields a
pass. The mitigation is that the pass line **echoes the target back**, so the check is only as good as
reading its own output — which is the honest limit of a one-line shell check against a variable the
operator supplies.

### ⚠ Why the BFF env change is NOT one-way (corrected)

The old binary **requires** `LENS_WORKSPACE_KEY` and `LENS_WORKSPACE_ID` and
refuses to start without them. The new binary **requires** `LENS_PROVISION_SECRET`
and refuses to start if `LENS_API_KEY` is present, while **ignoring** the two
workspace variables entirely. A file carrying all three — and no `LENS_API_KEY` —
therefore starts *both* binaries, which is why step 4 adds rather than swaps.

⚠ **This paragraph and step 4 used to disagree**: step 4 asserted no file could satisfy both
and declared itself one-way, while this section correctly said a file with all three starts
both. Step 4 was the wrong one, and it made rollback look like a two-artifact atomic restore
when it is a binary swap.

**If you do delete the old values**, rollback needs them back: the previous binary will not
boot without them, and the workspace key is hashed at rest in Lens — you would have to mint a
new one and look the workspace id up. `bff.env.pre-signup` is cheap insurance against exactly
that, but following step 4 as written means you never need it.

**Rolling the BFF back does not roll back the Lens workspaces.** Every workspace
provisioned during the window keeps existing, keeps its balance, and keeps
`cache_poolable = false`. That is harmless — they are simply unused until the
suite rolls forward again. Nothing needs cleaning up.

## The one thing that is not reversible at all

People who sign in after this lands get **their own empty workspace**. Their
history is not in it — the shared `default` history is co-mingled across every
trial user and cannot be attributed per person. That is the intended outcome and
`default` is deliberately untouched (its balance, keys and ledger rows, including
the ones your deploy was verified against, all stay). But a user who signs in,
sees an empty ledger, and asks where their data went is asking a fair question,
and the answer is "it was never yours individually" — worth saying to trial users
before they discover it.
