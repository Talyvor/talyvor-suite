# decision-expiry.sh — every deploy decision that rests on a premise, and a command that says
# whether that premise still holds.
#
# ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Three decisions in one night were correct when made and wrong an hour later, because someone
# removed the constraint each was reasoned from. Nothing was careless: the premise was verified
# from source every time. The failure is structural — **the conclusion is written in timeless
# present tense and the premise is buried in the justification**, so a reader (including the
# author, later) meets the verdict and never re-derives what it rests on.
#
# A reopening condition written as prose is a description someone must remember to evaluate.
# This file makes each one a COMMAND. If a premise has moved, this exits non-zero and names the
# document section that is now void.
#
# ⚠ THIS IS THE WEAKEST OF THE THREE FORMS, AND IT IS USED ONLY WHERE THE STRONGER TWO CANNOT
# REACH. In order of strength:
#   1. A derived value that FAILS TO COMPILE when its premise goes. Gold standard — suite #59
#      made the shared-Docs disclosure a compile error rather than a silently-false string.
#   2. A TEST that fails. Second best, with one caveat learned the hard way (talyvor-docs):
#      the test must exercise the PRODUCTION path. An expiry driving a fake was neutralised
#      when the fake was adjusted for unrelated, locally sensible reasons.
#   3. A documented command — this file. It runs in CI, so it is not "someone remembers", but
#      it can only see what is greppable from this repo.
#
# ⚠ AND IT CANNOT SEE OTHER REPOSITORIES. Several of our decisions rest on premises in
# talyvor-track / talyvor-docs / talyvor-lens. Those are reported as UNCHECKABLE HERE — never as
# passes — with the repo and the check that would settle them. An expiry register that silently
# scores a cross-repo premise as "fine" would be the exact failure it exists to prevent.
#
# ⚠ AND IT WAS DOING EXACTLY THAT TO ITS OWN LOCAL HALF, through a door nobody was watching: a
# premise read out of a path THAT IS NOT THERE. Seven of these nine checks reported their
# premise as holding with their subject file moved aside — see `subject` below, which is the
# floor that closed it, and apps/web/src/expirySubjects.test.ts, which is what keeps it closed.
#
# Usage:  deploy/decision-expiry.sh          # CI runs this
#         deploy/decision-expiry.sh -v       # also print each premise as it is checked

# ⚠ THE CHECK MUST BE ABLE TO SAY NO. The footer tells a deployer to run these in the named
# repo, so the whole uncheckable half is worth exactly what the commands are worth. Two shapes
# were MEASURED to exit 0 while the premise is false or unmeasured, and both were in this file:
#
#   · `go test <pkg> -run <filter>` prints "ok … [no tests to run]" — and under -v the word
#     "PASS" — and EXITS 0 when the filter matches NO test. The entry below about Track's
#     200+[] said `-run Unknown`, and talyvor-track's internal/member/ has no test whose name
#     contains "Unknown" (fifteen that do not, at 9cfad34). It had been reporting a pass from a
#     run of nothing, while the test that DOES assert that premise sat there under another name.
#   · `grep -c` exits 0 for any count ≥ 1, so a trailing `# expect 2` is enforced by whoever is
#     reading, not by the command.
#
# So: pipe `go test -v` into a check on the `--- PASS: <TestName>` line, and compare a count
# rather than trusting grep's status. apps/web/src/settleCommands.test.ts holds both rules.

# subject FILE DECISION — the premise below is read out of FILE. Returns non-zero, and records

#
# ⚠ MOST CHECKS HERE ARE ABSENCE TESTS: they grep a path and VOID when the pattern is FOUND.
# `grep` exits 1 with no output both for "the pattern is not in that file" AND for "there is no

#
# MEASURED at 9d3d6c8, not reasoned about (~/talyvor-queue/w11-expiry-vacuity-census-3f7a.py
# moved each subject aside in turn, restored in a `finally`, sha256-verified back): SEVEN of the
# nine locally-checkable decisions printed `ok` with the file their premise lives in gone, and
# FOUR of those runs exited 0 under "All locally-checkable premises still hold."
#
# ⚠ D3 IS THE ONE THAT SETTLES IT, because it did not merely mis-answer — it ERRORED and was
# scored as a pass. With the compose fragment gone `grep -c` wrote nothing, so `[ "" -ne 3 ]`
# printed `integer expression expected` and exited 2; a non-zero `[` sends the `if` down its
# ELSE branch, which is `ok "member sync wired — all 3 variables present"`. The check announced
# three variables it had not counted. (Its count is now range-checked too — see D3.)
#
# ⚠ A MISSING LOCAL PATH IS A STALE DECISION, NOT AN UNCHECKABLE. `cannot` is for premises that
# live where this repo cannot read. A local anchor that stopped resolving is a different event:
# the decision is still documented, the runbook still tells an operator to rely on it, and
# nothing is watching it any more. That is what `void` is for, and it is what makes CI red.
#
# Guarded by apps/web/src/expirySubjects.test.ts, which runs THIS file against a sandbox with
# one subject removed at a time and fails on any `ok` that survives its own subject.

# PIPELINE AND ITS DEFINITION DELETED, the doc comment at the top of that file — "stampBuild writes
# the commit this bundle was built from into the build output" — still matched, and this check
# printed `ok` under "All locally-checkable premises still hold." It is the same failure D7's
# header records ("the test file and these very comments satisfy" it) and the one D9's header
# records ("a guard that cannot tell a mention from a setting"), on the file D9 strips comments
# out of, and it was the only check of the four positive ones that had never had the lesson
# applied. apps/web/src/expiryLiveCode.test.ts is what keeps it applied.

# ── D7 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ⚠ THIS CHECK HAS BEEN INVERTED, and the inversion is the point rather than a tidy-up.
#
# D7 was written FORWARD-LOOKING: it fired the moment `member-sync` appeared in apps/bff, to
# catch the exact case where nothing is failing when a document becomes stale. It worked —
# it fired on the commit that landed the nudge, naming the section to rewrite. 3a-bis has now
# been rewritten and the decision it guarded ("a first-visit 403 lasting up to 15 minutes,
# fixed by restarting Docs") is VOID.
#
# But a fire-once trigger cannot be left in place after it fires: it can never go green again,
# so it would either be silenced — which this script's own footer forbids — or normalised into
# a permanently-red step everyone learns to scroll past. Deleting it is just as wrong: the
# claim in 3a-bis got STRONGER, not weaker. It used to warn about a wait; it now PROMISES
# there is none, and a promise is the more expensive thing to have go quietly false.
#
# So D7 now guards the new decision, in the opposite direction:
#
# DECISION: STEP 3a-bis tells the operator membership lands AT LOGIN — no wait, no restart —
#           and that a first-visit 403 is therefore a fault to investigate, not a known wait.
# PREMISE:  the BFF actually calls Docs' on-demand member-sync at login.
#
# If that call is ever removed, refactored out, or renamed, the runbook silently goes back to
# promising something nobody delivers — and the failure is invisible, because the 2-minute
# sweep still makes it eventually work. An operator would be told to chase a misconfiguration
# that is not there. Both halves are checked, so the document and the code cannot drift apart
# in either direction.
#
# ⚠ THE CODE-SIDE DETECTOR IS NARROW ON PURPOSE, and it was WRONG on the first attempt. It
# matched `member-sync` anywhere in apps/bff/*.go, which the test file and these very comments
# satisfy — so deleting the production call left the check GREEN. It was caught by deliberately
# breaking it rather than by reading it: a guard nobody has watched fail is not known to guard.
# It now matches the CALL, in non-test source only. Keep it that way: widening it back to a
# word that appears in prose restores the hole.
#
# ⚠⚠ AND THAT NARROWING CLOSED THE PROSE DOOR AND LEFT THE COMMENTED-OUT-CALL DOOR OPEN, WHICH
# IS THE SAME DOOR. Measured 2026-08-28 at 94b9899: comment out the whole `if trackWS != ""`
# block in apps/bff/auth.go — it still COMPILES and `go vet` is clean — and `grep -qF
# 'a.nudgeDocsMemberSync('` matches the disabled call exactly as well as the live one did.
# `_d7_code=1`, this check printed `ok`, and the register exited 0 saying every locally-checkable
# premise holds, while the login-time nudge 3a-bis PROMISES was gone. The product IS defended —
# the BFF test TestDocsNudge_FailureDoesNotAbortLogin fails on that same mutation — so what was
# blind is this register, whose whole job is to tell a deployer the premise still holds.
# Comment lines are dropped before the match now, the way D9 already does it, and
# apps/web/src/expiryLiveCode.test.ts is what keeps both halves honest.
#
# ⚠⚠⚠ AND THE FIRST FIX FOR IT WAS `grep -v … | grep -qF …`, WHICH IS GREEN ON macOS AND RED ON
# LINUX, SO A FULL LOCAL GAUNTLET PASSED AND CI CAUGHT IT. This script sets `-o pipefail`. GNU
# grep's `-q` exits the moment it matches; the upstream `grep -v` is then killed by SIGPIPE, the
# pipeline's status is 141, and `&& _d7_code=1` never runs — so D7 VOIDED on a healthy premise
# and took the whole register to exit 1. BSD grep reads to EOF, so the identical pipeline returns
# 0 on a workstation. Measured both ways in a debian:bookworm-slim container against this repo:
# 141 with pipefail, 0 without it, 0 on macOS. THE RULE: under `pipefail`, never read the STATUS
# of a pipeline that ends in `grep -q` — count with `grep -c`, which reads to EOF, and compare
# the number. That is what this file's own `cannot` header has always said about `grep -c`, for
# a different reason, and it is now true for two. The shape is guarded statically in
# apps/web/src/expiryLiveCode.test.ts so the next one is caught before CI rather than by it.
#
# ⚠ ONLY THE DOCUMENT HALF TAKES A `subject` GATE, and that is a statement about the two halves
# rather than an omission. The code half is a GLOB over apps/bff/*.go looking for the CALL: it
# already fails closed, because a glob that matches nothing leaves `_d7_code=0` and voids. The
# document half names ONE path, which is the shape that cannot tell a missing file from a
# rewritten section — and the void it would otherwise print blames the wording for the absence
# of the whole document, which is the wrong diagnosis by exactly the distance that costs a
# reader an hour.
#
# ⚠ AND THE CODE HALF READS apps/bff/auth.go ONLY, since B26.21 put a second call in
# track_tenant.go (the nudge for a workspace first resolved after login). The promise is the
# LOGIN-time call; a glob over every file would stay green with that one commented out. A
# missing auth.go reads as zero hits and voids, so it still fails closed.

# ── THE PREMISE UNDER A CLAIM THIS PAGE DOES NOT MAKE, AND WHY IT IS HERE ────
# DECISION: areas/marketing/Landing.tsx withholds "the cost of an issue, a document or a change
#           lands in one ledger", and Landing.test.tsx pins the page's silence.
# PREMISE:  what Docs can say about a page's own AI cost is a LOWER BOUND.
#
# ⚠ THIS ENTRY EXISTS BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS PREMISE EXPIRED WITH NOTHING WATCHING IT. The reason
# written beside that assertion was "Docs tags its own Lens calls by FEATURE and never by page, so
# no per-page attribution exists to report", with a restore condition naming an upstream shape.
# MEASURED read-only at talyvor-docs 63b7ea6, three independent ways: the attribution test PASSES,
# migration 0018 adds pages.own_ai_cost_usd plus the page_ai_spend_events ledger, and
# cmd/docs/main.go wires the binder into the production engine. Docs attributes AI spend to a page
# today, and 0018's header names THIS page's sentence as the thing it was built to make true.
#
# ⚠ WHY NO TEST HERE COULD HAVE CAUGHT IT, which is what puts it in the uncheckable half rather
# than in form 1 or 2. The guard is an ABSENCE test over the rendered page: it asserts the sentence
# is not there. That is green for every possible state of talyvor-docs — no upstream change can red
# it, in either direction. The claim guard is right to be shaped that way (its job is to hold the
# page); the consequence is that the premise underneath it had no instrument at all.
#
# ⚠ THE COMMAND WAS RUN IN EVERY STATE, on a pristine `git archive` export of talyvor-docs 63b7ea6
# rather than in a working tree another session holds (~/talyvor-queue/w11-pagecost-premise-controls-3c5f.py):
#   both tests present and passing                                              EXIT 0
#   EachSinglePageOperationBindsItsPage renamed away — count 1, not 2           EXIT 1
#   the production binder unwired, so the binding test FAILS                    EXIT 1
#   the exclusion test renamed away — the LOWER-BOUND half alone going dark     EXIT 1
#   the bare `go test … -run` form this register forbids, on the renamed tree   EXIT 0
# The second-to-last line is the control: on a tree where the named test is gone, the forbidden
# shape still answers yes. Both names are matched because the premise has two halves — attribution
# EXISTS, and it is INCOMPLETE — and a command that checked only the first still reported EXIT 0 on
# the tree where the second had gone dark (measured, S4b).
#
# ⚠ THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS COMMAND WAS FAIL-OPEN AND THE CONTROLS ARE WHY THAT IS NOT SHIPPED. It
# matched `TestAttribution_` as a PREFIX and passed the -run regex unanchored, so a test renamed to
# `…BindsItsPageRenamed` still matched -run, still printed `--- PASS: TestAttribution_…`, and still
# counted — the rename control it exists for reported EXIT 0. Both ends are anchored now: `^…$` on
# the filter and the FULL names, with the trailing space `go test` prints before the duration, on
# the count. The generic-prefix shape is a third measured hazard on top of the register's two.

NEEDS NO DATABASE — measured cold TWICE at docs 313eb86 and df4a90d with every *_TEST_DATABASE_URL stripped from the environment: green. TestAttribution_* drives a recordingBinder and a lensStub and opens no connection, which is why this is the one go test entry here with no prerequisite guard, and why that arm of the rule is a measurement rather than an escape hatch. THE THIRD SUBJECT IS READ BY THE SECOND HALF, AND UNTIL 2026-08-27 IT WAS READ BY NOTHING: the two attribution tests drive a recordingBinder fake and a lensStub and open no connection, so migrations/0018 — declared as a subject of this premise because own_ai_cost_usd is the column the premise names — could be emptied AND deleted, against a FRESH database, with this command still exiting 0 (measured per (entry, subject) at docs 313eb86, ~/talyvor-queue/w171-subject-arming-census-j8w4.py: 51 pairs, 50 armed, this one inert). The comment strip is not decoration: own_ai_cost_usd appears FIVE times in this migration's prose, so a bare grep for the name is satisfied by a paragraph, and without \`sed 's/--.*//'\` a DDL line COMMENTED OUT still answers yes — the prose-satisfies-the-assertion failure this register has paid for twice already"

# ── THE MONEY ALLOW-LIST, AND WHY IT IS HERE RATHER THAN IN A TEST ───────────
# DECISION: apps/bff/billing.go keeps its OWN copy of Lens's accepted top-up sizes
#           (allowedTopUpCents), refuses anything else in amountAllowed BEFORE dialing Lens, and
#           serves the list to the screen from /api/lxc/topup-options so the UI can never draw a
#           button this BFF would reject.
# PREMISE:  Lens still accepts exactly those three sizes.
#
# ⚠ THE MITIGATION THIS ENTRY REPLACES WAS A RESTATEMENT WEARING THE WORD "PIN". billing.go's
# header said "a test pins the values against the Lens source". MEASURED: the test declared the
# same three literals in the same package and compared copy to copy — it read nothing of
# talyvor-lens, and no test here can. CI checks out this repository alone, so a guard that reads a
# sibling repo only when it happens to be present is inert in CI, which is exactly where it would
# have to fire. That is this register's own "weakest of the three forms" argument arriving from
# below: form 2 was unavailable, and calling it form 2 anyway is worse than admitting form 3.
#
# ⚠ THE OPEN DIRECTION IS THE APPEND, WHICH IS ALSO THE ONLY DIRECTION THE LIST IS DOCUMENTED TO
# MOVE IN. Both repos state the list is ADDITIVE-ONLY (an async payment can settle days after the
# session is created and the webhook re-checks the list, so removing a size would mark a
# legitimately-paid purchase anomalous). Removal is already covered at runtime — Lens answers 400
# and handleLXCCheckout reports allow-list drift naming both lists. An APPEND is silent in both
# repos: Lens sells a fourth size, this BFF refuses it before any dial, the screen never offers it,
# nothing goes red, and the only symptom is revenue that never arrives.
#
# ⚠ THE COMMAND WAS RUN IN A REAL talyvor-lens CHECKOUT IN EVERY STATE BEFORE BEING WRITTEN DOWN,
# because a prescription nobody has watched fail is not known to fail:
#   today's three sizes                                                        EXIT 0
#   the same command against an APPENDED fourth size — the arrival case        EXIT 1
#   the file absent: grep writes nothing to stdout, so `[ "" = 1 ]` is false   EXIT 1
#   the bare `grep -c … FILE` form this register forbids, same absent file     EXIT 2
# It greps the WHOLE declaration line for that reason: a pattern matching only the name would go
# on saying yes across the one change this premise exists to catch.
#
# apps/web/src/topUpMirrorRegister.test.ts keeps the amounts in this command equal to the amounts
# apps/bff/billing.go enforces. Without it a deployer can get a confident yes about a list this
# BFF does not use — a pass for the wrong question, which is worse than no entry at all.

# DECISION: the login nudge sends the transit proof and NO identity headers.
# PREMISE:  Docs' /v1/service/ lane is exempt from membership authz but NOT from the gateway
#           secret. Added after the nudge 403ed in production for its entire life: it was
#           mounted behind authz, which refuses a request with no verified email, and the BFF
#           correctly sends none.
#
# ⚠ THE LOCAL HALF IS CHECKABLE AND IS THE ONE THAT BITES. Docs' authz 403s only on a MISSING
#   email and passes one resolving to zero memberships, so adding X-User-Email here would make
#   a future 403 disappear while re-coupling a service call to the user lane. That is the fix
#   someone reaches for at 2am, and this is what stops it.
#
# ⚠ THIS IS THE ONE WHERE THE MISSING-SUBJECT HOLE HAD TEETH, and it is why `subject` was added
# rather than the four cheaper checks being left alone. D7's code half asks whether the nudge is
# CALLED and globs the whole package for it; D8 asks what the nudge SENDS and names one file. So
# a refactor that moves the request construction out of apps/bff/docs_membersync.go — into the
# caller, into a shared client — keeps D7 green (the call is still somewhere in apps/bff/*.go)

# ── THE SEVEN CROSS-REPO STRUCT MIRRORS, AND THE SENTENCE THAT STOOD IN FOR THEM ────
# DECISION: apps/web/src/areas/track/types.ts and apps/web/src/areas/docs/api.ts declare
#           TypeScript shapes for structs that live in talyvor-track and talyvor-docs, and every
#           screen and fixture in those areas is typed off them.
# PREMISE:  each interface, PLUS the upstream fields it declares it does not mirror, is still the
#           whole upstream struct.
#
# ⚠ THESE ENTRIES EXIST BECAUSE THE PREMISE WAS CARRIED BY A SENTENCE INSTEAD, AND THE SENTENCE WAS
# FALSE IN BOTH FILES. types.ts said "JSON-verbatim from talyvor-track @ a3bc7b2 … so the day the
# BFF proxies these routes, the fixture types are already the live types" while TrackIssue held 21
# of model.Issue's 30 json fields; `labels` and `sort_order` carry no omitempty, so they are on
# EVERY issue response. api.ts said "Shapes mirror talyvor-docs internal/model/model.go VERBATIM
# (field-for-field, at e0cf605) — the types already speak the upstream shape" while DocsPage held
# 29 of model.Page's 31, missing own_ai_cost_usd and total_ai_cost_usd, both without omitempty.
# Neither is a live bug: the BFF streams these bodies through and the extra keys are invisible to
# TypeScript. The PROMISE is what was false, and no change in this repository could falsify it.
#
# ⚠ WHY THIS IS THE WEAK FORM AND NOT A TEST, AGAIN. A test here would have to read a sibling
# repository. CI checks out this one alone, so it would be inert exactly where it must fire — the
# argument topUpMirrorRegister.test.ts measured for the money allow-list, arriving unchanged for
# shapes. apps/web/src/mirrorSubsetRegister.test.ts holds the half that IS local: the field set
# each command below asks about equals the interface's own fields plus its declared UPSTREAM-ONLY
# names. Without it a deployer can get a confident yes about a struct this repo does not believe
# in, which is a pass for the wrong question.
#
# ⚠ THE COMMAND IS A THIRD SHAPE, SO IT WAS RUN IN EVERY STATE BEFORE BEING WRITTEN DOWN — the
# register's two known hazards (`go test -run` matching nothing, `grep -c` trusted for its exit
# status) are both about a pipeline that answers yes having looked at nothing:
#   the struct as it is today                                                    EXIT 0
#   one field APPENDED to the struct — the arrival case                          EXIT 1
#   one field DELETED from the struct                                            EXIT 1
#   `omitempty` added to a field that had none — optionality is half the claim    EXIT 1
#   the struct RENAMED: sed matches nothing, "" is not the expected list          EXIT 1
#   the FILE absent: sed writes nothing to stdout, same comparison                EXIT 1
#   the forbidden shape — the same pipeline ending `| grep -q .` instead of comparing:
#     file absent EXIT 1, struct renamed EXIT 1 — so it is NOT blind where I predicted, because
#     sed keys on the struct name and prints nothing either way. It is blind to the three cases
#     this premise is actually about: a field APPENDED  EXIT 0, a field DELETED  EXIT 0, and an
#     omitempty that came or went  EXIT 0. The struct still prints tags, so the shape that reads
#     "did anything come out" confirms a field set that has moved underneath it — and the APPEND
#     is the documented arrival case. Comparing the captured list is the only form that sees it.
# LC_ALL=C is not decoration: the expected list is sorted in this repo by codepoint, and a
# collation that ignores `_` would order `created_at` against `creator_id` differently.
# ── WIRE VERSUS DECLARATION ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# ⚠ EVERY MIRROR ENTRY BELOW EXTRACTS json TAGS OUT OF A STRUCT DECLARATION. THAT IS A PROXY FOR
# THE WIRE, AND MEASURED 2026-08-28 AT e4ba7f4 IT IS A PROXY WITH THREE HOLES — each of which
# COMPILES and leaves the extracted tag set byte-identical:
#
#   1. a custom MarshalJSON / UnmarshalJSON on the type, in a NEW file of the same package.
#      Verified end to end on talyvor-track model.Workspace in a read-only git archive export:
#      go build ./... exit 0, go vet clean, and the response becomes a single unrelated key —
#      EVERY DECLARED TAG GONE FROM THE WIRE — while the settle command still reported the mirror
#      as holding. (go test -short ./... on that export is identical to baseline; the
#      real-Postgres half was not run and is not claimed.)
#   2. an EXPORTED FIELD WITH NO json TAG. encoding/json puts it on the wire under its Go name,
#      and an extraction that reads json:"…" cannot see it. This is the likeliest of the three:
#      a field added in a hurry.
#   3. an EMBEDDED field, which promotes another type's fields — and its MarshalJSON — onto this
#      one without a single tag changing here.
#
# So each entry below carries two more clauses: FIELD LINES = TAGGED LINES inside the declaration
# window, which refuses 2 and 3, and NO (Un)MarshalJSON for that type in its package, which
# refuses 1. All fifteen HOLD on read-only exports of origin/main, and all forty-five mutations —
# three per entry, run against the command THIS FILE PRINTS rather than a reconstruction — are
# caught. A properly TAGGED field added to the struct does NOT red these two, which is correct:
# the tag-set comparison is what sees that, and it already did.
#
# ⚠ THE BOUNDARY, SO IT IS NOT OVERQUOTED: this makes the DECLARATION honest about itself. It
# still cannot see a handler that wraps the struct before writing it. The six request-body
# entries that extract from an ANONYMOUS struct at a route mount are out of population BY
# CONSTRUCTION — no method can attach to an anonymous type, so hole 1 cannot exist there.
#
# ⚠ ALL FIFTEEN CURRENTLY DECLARE ZERO CUSTOM MARSHALLERS, ZERO EMBEDDED FIELDS AND ZERO UNTAGGED
# FIELDS — censused before the clauses were written, so this fixes no live divergence. What was
# missing is that nothing would have noticed one. R11 in apps/web/src/settleCommands.test.ts is
# what stops a sixteenth mirror arriving without them.

# ⚠ THE ENTRY ABOVE COVERS AN AUTHZ KEY IT WAS NOT WRITTEN FOR, AND ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PREMISE
# THIS ONE PINS. `apps/bff/lens.go#docsSpaceCreateBody` overwrites `workspace_id` in the create-space
# body with the SESSION's workspace, because Docs authorizes THAT FIELD against membership and "the
# field an attacker edits should not exist in the request at all". The key it pins is a talyvor-docs
# key — and the only thing asking talyvor-docs about it is the Space mirror above, which pins
# `model.Space`'s tag set. That covers the create request ONLY because Docs' Create decodes into
# model.Space. Nothing recorded that, so the coverage was an accident nobody could see.
# ⚠ WHY IT MATTERS, MEASURED at suite `491eb21c` by calling docsSpaceCreateBody directly rather than
# reasoning about it — the pin is exact and the pass-through is total:
#   {"name":"Eng","workspace_id":"ws-ATTACKER"}  ->  {"name":"Eng","workspace_id":"ws-SESSION"}
#   {"name":"Eng","ws_id":"ws-ATTACKER"}         ->  {"name":"Eng","workspace_id":"ws-SESSION",

# Every key that is not `workspace_id` is forwarded VERBATIM, by design (decoding into a fixed struct
# would silently drop fields Docs supports). So on the day Docs authorizes on a DIFFERENTLY NAMED
# field, the BFF's pin lands on a key Docs ignores and the browser's own value under the new name is
# ALREADY being forwarded — the server-pinned authz field becomes client-controlled with no error
# anywhere. Docs' membership check still bounds it to workspaces the caller belongs to, which is
# precisely the residual the BFF comment names: "a user in two workspaces could still create in the
# wrong one". A rename of `model.Space` is caught by the mirror; a create handler that stops binding
# model.Space is caught HERE and by nothing else.
# ⚠ 5/5 controls against a real docs export: Create binding its OWN request struct -> RED (the exact
# fragility case) · Create renamed -> RED (empty capture) · handler.go emptied -> RED · a reworded

# ── THE PAGE-WRITE SEAM, WHERE THE MIRROR ABOVE READS AS COVERAGE AND IS NOT ──
# DECISION: apps/bff forwards the two Docs PAGE writes VERBATIM — docsCreatePage (POST
#           /v1/spaces/{s}/pages) and docsUpdatePage (PATCH /v1/spaces/{s}/pages/{p}), the last
#           two of the six `forwardProduct` calls that hand upstream the caller's own r.Body.
#           "Docs owns its schema, and re-encoding here would invent a second schema to drift
#           from." The browser therefore authors the wire: areas/docs/api.ts#updatePage sends
#           `title` and `content_text`, #createPage sends `title`.
# PREMISE:  those keys are still keys talyvor-docs will APPLY.
#
# ⚠ THE DocsPage MIRROR ABOVE DOES NOT COVER THE PATCH, AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT DOES. It pins
# `model.Page`'s json tags — but page Update does NOT decode into model.Page. It decodes into
# `map[string]any` and the gate is `updatableFields` in internal/page/store.go, a set the mirror
# never reads. The two disagree in BOTH directions and upstream says so in its own comment:
# `content_text` IS applied and is NOT in the allowlist (it is admitted by an explicit
# `k != "content_text"` exception), while `ai_cost_usd` is a model.Page tag that is deliberately
# NOT applicable. So the mirror can stay green over a page-write seam that has stopped writing.
#
# ⚠ WHAT A DRIFT COSTS HERE IS THE EDIT, AND THE CALLER IS TOLD NOTHING. Measured by reading the
# upstream store at docs `fd96dec7`: an un-allowlisted key is `continue`d — "DROPPED IN SILENCE
# rather than refused — the rest of the request still lands" — and when nothing survives the gate
# the method returns `s.GetByID(ctx, id)`, so Update answers **200 with the page body**. The
# handler's own `updates["updated_by"]` keeps `set` non-empty, which means the row's updated_at
# still moves: a save that stored nothing is indistinguishable from a save that worked, and the
# page even looks freshly touched.
#
# ⚠ THE EXCEPTION IS THE FRAGILE ONE ON PURPOSE. `content_text` is the ONLY key the suite's page
# editor writes (PageView.tsx), and it reaches the column through a hardcoded string exception in
# an allowlist loop — which is exactly what a tidy-up deletes. The queue's standing finding about
# this editor is that it writes the SEARCH PROJECTION rather than the document; that is a product
# DECISION (W2.3) and is not touched here. This entry is the narrower, undecided thing: whichever
# way that decision goes, nobody in either repo is asking whether the write still lands at all.
#
# ⚠ 12/12 controls, each predicted before it ran, against a disposable `git archive` export of
# talyvor-docs (the object store, never the working tree — that repo is held by another tab):
# exception removed -> RED (the defect) · an allowlist key renamed -> RED · a key ADDED -> RED ·
# updatableFields renamed -> RED · store.go emptied -> RED · **the comment that QUOTES the
# exception reworded -> GREEN**, the must-stay-green that forced the `!allowed &&` anchor: the
# obvious `grep -o 'k != "content_text"'` matches that comment line TOO and would have reddened

# asserts the stripped body carries neither key — the right assertion over a FAKE Docs whose row
# this repository hardcodes, so both halves of the comparison live here and it is green whatever
# upstream serves. The DocsPage mirror above pins model.Page's tags, so a RENAME of `content` is
# caught — but NOT the list route ceasing to serve model.Page at all. `page.Handler.List` returns
# whatever `Store.List` returns, and a projection type added for the tree view (the ordinary
# reason to add one) leaves model.Page untouched, the mirror green, and both deletes matching
# nothing.

# ⚠ MEASURED, NOT REASONED, at docs fd96dec790454b133847a399be28704c0ce369ec — docs' own mounted
# route over a real pgvector Postgres, in a disposable `git archive` export (that repo was held by

# VERBATIM in the unstripped body, and 5885 bytes after the BFF's two deletes. The premise holds
# today; nothing in this repo can see the day it stops, and the failure ships a document body
# rather than blanking a field.
#
# ⚠ THE COMMAND CAPTURES THE RETURN TYPE, NOT THE FUNCTION'S EXISTENCE. `grep -c 'Store) List('`

# ([]model.PageSummary, mismatch). An empty capture FAILS this comparison rather than passing it.
#

# WAS FALSE — the exact failure this file's own header names. The paragraph above says the other
# half out loud: "`page.Handler.List` returns whatever `Store.List` returns". That sentence IS a
# premise and the command did not read it. MEASURED at docs 806109b5 against a disposable
# `git archive` export, mutating the HANDLER and leaving the store alone:
#   a projection added in page.Handler.List  -> Store.List still returns []model.Page -> EXIT 0
#   page.Handler.List renamed                                                         -> EXIT 0
#   internal/page/handler.go DELETED                                                  -> EXIT 0
#   the store's value served through a second identifier (`shaped := forTree(out)`)   -> EXIT 0
# Four ways for the list route to stop serving model.Page rows with this register reporting that
# it still does — and model.Page's tags are untouched throughout, so the DocsPage mirror above
# stays green through all four as well.
# ⚠ THE CONSEQUENCE IS NOT A BLANKED FIELD, IT IS A DOCUMENT. Measured through the real
# apps/bff#stripPageContentList rather than reasoned about: a projected row carrying the page body
# under `body` went in at 120 bytes and came out at 120 bytes — both deletes matched nothing, no
# error, no 502, a 200 with the whole ProseMirror document on the space tree.
# ⚠ SO THE COMMAND NOW READS BOTH HALVES IN ONE COMPARISON, and both files are declared subjects
# because both are read. A `sed` command has no build graph to reach a file it does not name,
# which is why R6 in apps/web/src/settleCommands.test.ts no longer waves a `.go` subject through

# ── THE SAME CLASS AGAIN, ONE PARAMETER WIDE, AND IT IS THE WORST SHAPE OF IT ─
# DECISION: apps/bff's Docs search route (docs_search.go) refuses a mistyped `type` with 400,
#           refuses a two-source page past 50 rows with 400, EXEMPTS the single-source path from
#           that ceiling, and rebuilds the query from exactly five keys rather than forwarding it.
# PREMISE:  five separate facts about talyvor-docs' search handler — its merged-row ceiling, the
#           five keys it reads, the three values it discriminates on, what it does with a fourth,
#           and where it applies the offset.
#
# ⚠ A QUERY PARAMETER IS THE WORST CASE OF THIS WHOLE CLASS AND THAT IS WHY THESE ARE HERE. A
# response shape that drifts renders a blank field. A request BODY key that drifts is a 200 with a
# billed completion that read nothing (#234). A query PARAMETER that drifts is worse than both:
# `r.URL.Query().Get` returns "" for a renamed key, and Docs then DEFAULTS `type` to `all` — so a
# renamed `type` upstream means a `type=semantic` search silently stops asking for the semantic
# half, and the answer is a 200 of full-text rows BYTE-IDENTICAL to a correct one. Semantic page
# search is one of W1.7's eight AI features and its half embeds the query through Lens on every
# call, so this sits on a metered path as well as a silent one.
#
# ⚠ ALL FIVE RUN TRUE TODAY, WHICH IS WHY THEY ARE ENTRIES AND NOT A FIX. MEASURED BY EXECUTING
# docs' OWN search handler at 8189d7b5 — a `git archive` scratch export; that repo was held by
# another tab and was NEVER written to — over a recording full-text store, a recording pgxDB and an
# httptest stand-in for the Lens embeddings endpoint, so "which half ran" is an observation:
#   type=banana / ALL / Fulltext / full-text → 200 {"results":[],"total":0}, ft NOT called, 0 embeds
#   type absent / type=all                   → ft(10, 0) AND one embedding
#   type=fulltext&limit=5&offset=7           → ft(5, 7)          — the offset reached SQL
#   type=semantic&limit=5&offset=7           → pgvector LIMIT 5 OFFSET 7
#   type=all&limit=5&offset=7                → ft(12, 0)         — merged, offset applied after
#   type=all&limit=10&offset=45              → ft(50, 0)         — the 50-row window
#   type=fulltext&limit=10&offset=90         → ft(10, 90)        — single-source pages past it
# INSTRUMENT CONTROL, because "the sixth key was ignored" and "the recorder sees no key at all" are
# the same line: type=semantic&space_id=sp-1 puts a non-nil space in the pgvector $4, while
# space=sp-1 and spaceId=sp-1 leave it nil.
#
# ⚠ AND THE COMMANDS WERE RUN IN EVERY STATE BEFORE BEING WRITTEN DOWN — 14 caught, 2
# predicted-green, 0 anomalies (~/talyvor-queue/w171-docssearch-register-controls-4b7e.py), each
# mutation restored in a `finally` and sha256-verified back. The two vacuity cases are the ones that
# matter: with the Search FUNCTION renamed, and with the handler file EMPTIED, every one of these
# exits non-zero rather than confirming a premise it never looked at.
#
# ⚠ ONE MEASURED BOUNDARY, WRITTEN HERE RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE TRUSTED. The `type` dispatch entry
# pins the SHAPE of docs' two arms, so an upstream `else` branch that runs a half for an
# unrecognised type leaves both arms untouched and that command GREEN. Predicted green, measured
# green (control B1). It catches an arm being inverted or re-aimed; it does not catch a third arm.
#
# apps/web/src/docsSearchRegister.test.ts keeps the values in these commands equal to the values
# docs_search.go actually enforces, and derives the populations — the wire keys from the route's own
# `out.Set` calls, the discriminator from its type map, the window from its constant, and the
# behavioural half from every refusal constant it declares — so a sixth parameter, a fourth type or
# a third refusal cannot be added with nothing asking talyvor-docs about it.

A command must test the premise, not a proxy for it. Verified BOTH DIRECTIONS against real history in read-only git archive exports: at d54d375 the set is 'kind != all|kind != fulltext|kind != semantic|' and the 400 count is 2 (EXIT 0); at 48c8336, the commit before, the set is EMPTY and the count is 1 (EXIT 1).

# ⚠ THE FIVE ENTRIES ABOVE ARE ALL ABOUT THE REQUEST. THIS ONE IS ABOUT THE ANSWER, AND IT IS THE
# ONLY CROSS-REPO CLAIM ON THIS ROUTE THAT A MONEY SENTENCE RESTS ON. The four request-side premises
# decide what gets ASKED; `source` decides what the screen is allowed to SAY it was billed for.
# MEASURED, not reasoned about, by driving the shipped card at suite `567e6d6a` with the dual-match
# literal renamed (`both` -> `hybrid`, which is exactly what an upstream rename produces on the wire):
#   source "both"   -> semantic:"ran"     -> "Embedding the query WAS a metered Lens call billed to
#                                            this workspace under docs-search"
#   source "hybrid" -> semantic:"unknown" -> "WHERE LENS IS CONFIGURED, embedding the query is a
#                                            metered call … Only a row from the semantic index
#                                            proves it happened here"
# So one renamed literal converts a definite charge into a conditional, on a search the workspace WAS
# billed for — and the hedge it falls back to explains itself with "Docs merges an unconfigured
# semantic search in as an empty list", which is FALSE on that very response. The classifier reads
# only the two positive literals, so a rename can never FABRICATE evidence; it silently DELETES it,
# which is the direction no screen can detect.
# ⚠ AND NO TEST IN THIS REPO CAN SEE IT, BY CONSTRUCTION. Censused at 567e6d6a: the dual-match
# literal appears six times in apps/web — three in search.ts (the union and the two classifier arms)
# and three in fixtures authored HERE (search.test.ts x2, searchDocs.test.tsx x1). Both halves of
# every comparison live in this repository, so the fixtures go on passing with the old literal while
# production receives the new one. That is what makes it a register entry and not a test.
# ⚠ MEASURED AND CURRENTLY TRUE, so it is recorded rather than pinned as a sixth claim: the `both`
# tag is decided by `simScore > 0` on a map lookup that returns 0.0 for a MISS, so it would lose a
# dual match whose similarity were exactly 0 — upstream's `similarityThreshold = 0.75`
# (internal/search/semantic.go:38) means a returned row is always >= 0.75, so the condition is sound
# today. This entry pins the emitted SET, not that condition; a re-aimed condition is a different
# question and is not asked here.

# ── THE THREE TRACK WRITE BODIES, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT ONE ENTRY ─────────────
# DECISION: apps/bff/track.go forwards three request bodies to talyvor-track VERBATIM — the
#           browser authors the keys and no Go struct in this repository names them, so
#           aiRequestBodyRegister.test.ts's `json.Marshal` census CANNOT see them by construction
#           and names them as a boundary. apps/web/src/trackWriteBodyRegister.test.ts derives the
#           population and each route's key set from source and requires the three entries below.
# PREMISE:  talyvor-track binds those six keys, AND the consequence of an upstream rename differs
#           by route.
#
# ⚠ ALL THREE DECODE THROUGH THE SAME HELPER AND THAT IS THE TRAP. `httpx.DecodeJSON` calls
# `dec.DisallowUnknownFields()`, which reads like "a renamed key is a 400 everywhere". It is not:
# encoding/json enforces that flag for STRUCT fields only. MEASURED with the flag toggled as its
# own control (struct+renamed, flag OFF → nil, so the struct result is the flag's doing and not
# the type's):
#
#     struct + {"headline":…}  flag ON  → json: unknown field "headline"   → 400 BAD_JSON
#     map    + {"state":…}     flag ON  → nil, map[state:x]                → the key sails through
#
# and `issue.Store.Update` then drops the unknown key WITHOUT A WORD (`continue`), runs no
# statement at all when nothing survives (`len(setClauses) == 0`), and returns the row unchanged:
# a 200 no caller can tell from a stored edit. Upstream has already paid for this once — the
# comment inside `updatableFields` records `PATCH {"milestone_id": …}` answering 200 with the
# field untouched. FOUR of this app's six keys are on that route.
#
# ⚠ THE TWO model.go COUNTS ARE FILE-WIDE ON PURPOSE, AND AN EXISTING GUARD IS WHY. The first
# draft scoped them with `sed -n '/^type Issue struct/,/^}/p'`, which is precise and which
# mirrorSubsetRegister.test.ts reads as a SECOND mirror entry for the same struct — its rule is
# exactly one `cannot` naming both `internal/model/model.go` and `type Issue struct`, and it went
# red on four assertions. The address is not needed: at 3672af1a `json:"title"` and `json:"body"`
# each occur EXACTLY ONCE in that file, so the count of 1 IS the block-scoped answer. If upstream
# grows a second `title` tag anywhere in model.go this reds — a false red that makes someone look,
# which is the direction to fail in.

# ── THE SIX REQUEST BODIES THIS BFF SENDS talyvor-lens ───────────────────────
#
# The sibling block above asks talyvor-docs and talyvor-track about the bodies this repo builds
# from a NAMED Go struct. These six are anonymous maps and struct literals — json.Marshal(
# map[string]int64{"usd_cents": …}) and friends — which is why aiRequestBodyRegister.test.ts's
# census could only put them in a bucket and count them. An anonymous literal is not a lesser
# claim about another repository; it is the same claim with nowhere to hang a test.
#
# ⚠ NOT ONE OF THE SIX LENS HANDLERS CALLS DisallowUnknownFields. That is the fact the whole
# block rests on and it was MEASURED, not assumed: a renamed key upstream is indistinguishable
# from an absent one, the field takes its ZERO VALUE, and the decode reports success. So the
# question is never "is it an error" — it is "what does the zero value DO", and that was answered
# by executing Lens's own code at f09348d1 in a read-only git archive export (the repo was held
# by another tab and was NEVER written to): the real newProvisionHandler over fakes for its two
# interfaces, and the real downstream validators for the five mounted as closures in main.go.
#
# ⚠⚠ THE MONEY ROUTES FAIL LOUD AND THE CONSENT ROUTES FAIL SILENT. Both amounts are refused by
# an upstream allow-list or minimum, so a renamed usd_cents or lxc_amount_ulxc is a 400 someone
# sees. Every route that records a CHOICE — pooling consent, distill policy, session lifetime —
# answers 200 and stores something else. That is the opposite of where the attention has gone,
# and it is why these six are one block rather than six scattered lines.
#
# The full nine-case verdict table is in apps/web/src/lensRequestBodyRegister.test.ts, which also
# holds each entry below to the key set this repo actually sends. CI here checks out this
# repository alone, so these commands are the only thing that asks Lens.

# ── THE METERED-SURFACE UPSTREAM COLUMN (W1.7.1, tab-p9r4) ───────────────────
# Both metered censuses carry an `upstream` field per surface — the call site in the other repo
# that makes that surface cost money — and both headers present it as holding the STALE
# direction: "an entry names the upstream call site that makes it metered. If a surface stops
# spending, its row must be DELETED rather than left passing."
#
# ⚠ THE ONLY ASSERTION ON THAT COLUMN IS `toMatch(/^internal\//)`, WHICH IS A SHAPE. Nothing
# asked either repo anything, and it showed: measured read-only at docs 48c8336 / track b2f282e,
# TWO of the nine pointers name a function that upstream does not declare — the Docs census wrote
# `Engine.Ask` where talyvor-docs declares `AskDocs`, and the Track census wrote `Engine.Triage`
# where talyvor-track declares `TriageIssue`. Both were wrong at the SHA each census pins, not
# drifted since. The line numbers, checked the same way, are all correct — they point at the
# `callAnthropicViaLens` CALL lines, which is what those tables' arrows say and is NOT the `func`
# line a first reading assumes.
#
# These two entries are what a deployer can run to settle the column. Both were verified by
# EXECUTING them against read-only `git archive` exports, and armed seven ways: every declared
# subject emptied AND deleted (3/3 pairs red), and six real premise moves red — including the two
# renames the suite currently mis-writes, which is the direct evidence these entries would have

Only running it showed that — including its negative direction, which is what the third clause exists to record: the first version compared the SET of mover names (sort -u) and ADDING A CALL SITE OF AN EXISTING MOVER DID NOT CHANGE IT, so it could not say no to the one change that matters. Counts per file, not a set of names. The second clause declares the symbol R9 joins on. The FIRST clause is the --- PASS: shape rather than a bare go test for a reason measured here too: TestSessionKey_AuthenticatesWithExactlyTheProxyScope holds the APIKeyID assertion and SKIPS without Postgres, and a bare \`go test\` exits 0 on that skip — so the source extraction in the fourth clause carries that half instead."

# ── D9 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# DECISION: a missing bundle file 404s instead of answering 200 with index.html, so the deploy
#           checks in README.md §6 and FULL-STACK-DEPLOY.md can read a STATUS CODE for
#           /assets/… and /version.json.
# PREMISE:  the BFF excludes exactly `/assets/` from the SPA fallback (apps/bff/lens.go,
#           bundleAssetsDir), and the web build still emits its files THERE — Vite's default
#           assetsDir, which apps/web/vite.config.ts does not override.
#
# ⚠ THE TWO HALVES ARE IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IN DIFFERENT DIRECTORIES AND NEITHER CAN SEE THE
#   OTHER. A Go test proves the BFF refuses `/assets/…`; nothing in it can observe where Vite
#   writes. Set `build: { assetsDir: 'static' }` and every check in both runbooks silently goes
#   back to reading a 200 that means nothing — with the BFF's test suite fully green, because
#   its fixture writes its own assets/ directory.
#
# ⚠ THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS CHECK GREPPED THE WHOLE FILE FOR `assetsDir` AND VOIDED IMMEDIATELY —
#   on the COMMENT that was added in the same change to warn against setting it. A guard that
#   cannot tell a mention from a setting reports the documentation as the defect. Comment lines
#   are stripped first, and the two directions are controlled: adding `assetsDir: 'static'` to
#   vite.config.ts voids this, and the warning prose alone does not.
#
# ⚠⚠ THE VITE HALF WAS `grep -v … | grep -qE …` AND WOULD HAVE FAILED TOWARD "FINE" IN EXACTLY
#   THE STATE IT EXISTS TO DETECT. Under this script's `-o pipefail`, GNU grep's `-q` exits on
#   the first match and the upstream `grep -v` dies of SIGPIPE, so the pipeline is 141 — non-zero
#   — and `|| _d9_vite=1` fires: "vite still writes there (default assetsDir)" ABOUT A FILE THAT
#   SETS assetsDir. Measured 2026-08-28 in debian:bookworm-slim: D7's identical shape on
#   apps/bff/auth.go returns 141 (10.8 KB still to write after the match), this one on
#   vite.config.ts returns 0 (2 KB to write — the writer finishes first). SO IT IS SAFE ONLY BY
#   THE SIZE OF THE FILE, AND FILES GROW. Counted instead, which reads to EOF. A count that is
#   not a number is -1 and voids, the way D3's already does.
#
# ⚠ THE VITE HALF IS AN ABSENCE TEST. `_d9_vite=1` means "assetsDir is NOT set", which is what a
# missing vite.config.ts also looks like: measured, D9 printed `ok` — "vite still writes there
# (default assetsDir)" — about a build configuration that was not on disk. The BFF half is a
# POSITIVE match and would void on its own, so gating it changes no verdict; it is gated anyway
# so the RULE is uniform — every literal path this file greps is asserted present first — and
