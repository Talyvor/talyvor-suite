// companies (B25.4's pairs): this user, a person whose browser calls the BFF as the app does, and the other company,
// whose software calls Lens with its own token. Every oracle is what Lens stored, read back from both sides; money is
// read on both agents' accounts: one posting on each side, both balances moved by exactly the amount, nothing else
// moved. A route for a feature Talyvor has switched off is checked to refuse and move nothing, naming the feature.
//
// Lens's routes that no BFF route leads to by the same path (the BFF's /api/wallets/… answer through /money-requests,
// /loans, /escrows, …) are reached once through the app and once straight on Lens, so both rows of the map are.
