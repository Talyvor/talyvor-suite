// B30.130 — invoices and pay links (Lens B30.20), on Lens's API, once a run, on two workspaces of its own.
//
// One test company's agent issues an invoice from its GBP account — two lines, VAT on one — and sends it, so Lens answers
// its number, reference, pay token and pay link with the total. The pay page behind the link is read with no credential:
// the invoice sent with the total due, no notice, no transfer to the Test partner's details (they reach no bank, B49.1),
// and none of the issuer's ids or the token on it. Another company's agent, with a GBP
// account of its own holding nothing, pays it through the link and must be refused 409 for want of money; the invoice
// must still read sent with the total due and no payment, and neither agent's account may have moved.
//
// shortcut: the payer holds nothing — Lens has no route that puts test money into an account until B30.15's payments-in
// webhook lands; once it has, fund the payer here (B30.14's payment reference) and assert the paid path: the issuer's
// account up by the total, the payer's down by it, the invoice paid.
