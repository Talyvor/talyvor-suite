// B34.7 — every Lens setting and workspace-data route has a tester. On the 6 Oct map the workspace's config and
// budgets, its switches (logging, document conversion, compression, Tare and its model, pooling and cost-optimised
// routing) and both previews, deleting stored answers and asking for deletion, provider keys, local endpoints and
// injection patterns, guardrails, prompts, fallback chains, batches, a catalog model, an issue's anomaly read and
// answer feedback read "not covered". Each scenario here runs on a workspace of its own, on that workspace's own key
// or token, the way its own software calls Lens: it sets a thing, reads it back from Lens, sees it change what Lens
// does or records for the next request, and sets it back. A route only Lens's operator may call is checked to refuse
// the workspace and change nothing; a route this deployment does not run is checked to refuse and move nothing.
