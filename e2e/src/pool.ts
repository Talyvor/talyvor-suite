// B28.283 — THE POOL DOES NOT LEAK OR GET POISONED. Lens serves one workspace's answer to another from its pool only
// when the first chose to share (cache_poolable) with its personal-data detection on, never an answer to a question
// carrying personal data, and only to the question as it was asked (talyvor-lens proxy storeCaches / sharesAnswers,
// cache_pooling MaybeAllowPooledHit). One scenario, on a workspace of its own — the contributor — and a second it makes
// — the reader, which shares too and has switched its own personal-data detection off, as a workspace fishing for other
// workspaces' answers would:
//   pool-isolation — first the reader is served from the pool a question the contributor asked while sharing, so the
//     pool is live between the two and anything below that leaked could be seen. Then:
//     1. the existence probe: with sharing off, the contributor asks a question (kept: its own repeat is replayed). The
//        reader asking it is asked afresh at the catalog price, and what Lens says about its cache and pool reads the
//        same as for a question nobody has asked: the reader cannot tell the contributor asked it.
//     2. personal data: sharing again, the contributor asks a question carrying an email and a phone number. It is not
//        kept (its own repeat is asked afresh), and the reader asking it is asked afresh, never served that answer.
//     3. direction and negation: the contributor asks "a minus b" and "is a greater than b". The reader asking "b minus
//        a" and "is a not greater than b" is asked afresh and not given the contributor's answer, while the two
//        questions as the contributor asked them are served from the pool. Whether a reworded question is served from
//        the pool — whether Lens's similarity pool is live, the layer a direction or negation would slip through — is
//        noted with the verdict.
//   B58.15 — it reads whether pooling is on for the deployment first (Lens B58.14, GET /v1/pooling): off, it cannot test
//     and says Lens's reason (SKIP), as a pool that is off and a miss look alike; on, a reader not served from the pool FAILs.
