// B32.90 — DISCOVERY. Lens's search, collections and trending (B32.50), on two workspaces of the run's own:
//   market-discovery — a seller publishes three listings with capabilities: extract at $0.04 a use and extract at $0.06,
//        both declared on the publish, and summarize at $0.01, declared after with PUT …/capabilities. Searched by
//        capability=extract and max_price_per_use=50000 (µUSD: $0.05), the $0.04 one is found and neither of the others,
//        and every hit declares extract and is billed at most $0.05 a use. Two controls make each absence mean its
//        filter: without the price the $0.06 one is found, and by capability=summarize the summarize one. A curator,
//        another workspace, publishes a public collection of the summarize and the $0.06 listings, in that order — not
//        the order they were published in —, and read by the seller it lists exactly those two in that order. The
//        operator features it, and the public collections list it first — ahead of an unfeatured one the curator makes
//        after it, which a list ordered only by the latest change would put first. Trending is computed nightly, so
//        sort=trending is held only to every hit carrying its distinct_buyers_7d and trending_score. The collections are
//        deleted after.
//   market-discover-screen — B32.61: the same search and a collection on the app's Discover screen. A seller publishes an
//        extract listing at $0.04 a use and one at $0.06; Discover opened filtered by capability extract and at most $0.05
//        a use shows the $0.04 one and not the $0.06 one, and a curator's public collection of the $0.06 then the $0.04
//        listing, opened from its link, shows exactly those two in that order. Lens's own reads of the search and the
//        collection are asked too, so a fault is the screen's only where Lens answered right; where Lens did not, it SKIPs.
//   market-ask-screen — B41.71: a seller publishes "Translate product descriptions into German" at $0.002 a use, and the
//        buyer asks Discover "translate 500 product descriptions into German". The screen shows up to three listings,
//        each with an estimated total, exactly those Lens's own ask answers in its order with its estimates, for 500
//        uses; where Lens picks the run's listing, its estimate is 500 × $0.002 = $1.00.
// Nothing is used or bought, so nothing is charged. A listing the similarity check holds (another night's of the same
// words) is approved by the operator first, as a person would: what is tested here is how it is found.
