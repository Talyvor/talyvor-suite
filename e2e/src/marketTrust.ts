// B32.89 — the trust panel (Lens B32.49), on Lens's API, once a run, on workspaces of its own.
//
// A new seller publishes a prompt listing with one per_use commercial offer at 100,000 µUSD. A workspace that has never
// paid for it reviews it and is refused (PUT …/marketplace/listings/{id}/review, 403). Two new buyers each make one billed
// use of it (POST …/listings/{id}/use) and review it, 5 and 3; the seller replies to the 3 (PUT …/reviews/{id}/reply). A
// fourth workspace is linked to the seller by a card both paid with (talyvor-lens B32.102's synthetic card link), makes a
// billed use, and is refused too. The workspace refused first then pays for a use, and reviews nothing.
//
// Lens's reads are the oracle. Each paying buyer's bill holds its one billed use of the listing (market_uses), not
// refunded: what makes it a paying buyer. The trust read (GET /v1/marketplace/listings/{id}/trust) counts the reviews of
// paying buyers not linked to the seller (market_reviews), so it must read count 2, average 4, one 3 and one 5, its recent
// reviews exactly the two the buyers wrote, the seller's reply on the 3. The refused workspace has paid by then, so a row
// its refused review wrote would count; that it does not is how the read shows none was written. A linked buyer's row is
// hidden from every read whatever was written, so its refusal is its 403 and the count. MCP market_listing, called with
// an agent's own key, must answer the same trust.
//
// The linked buyer is made by Lens's synthetic card link (B32.102, merged): a Lens without it FAILs, it no longer SKIPs.
