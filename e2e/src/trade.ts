// B25.4 — catalog v4: test users trade with each other, through every wallet, bank and marketplace
// function B25.3 made work for them. A person works the screens — Agent Wallets (/agents), a listing's
// page, Your listings & earnings — and the other company answers with its own token, straight to Lens,
// as another company's software would. Every oracle is a row read back from Lens, on both sides: the
// transfers, the request, the loan, the escrow, the pot, the schedule's run, the cash-out, the card,
// the listing's review, the bill and the seller's earnings, the Stripe account. Never a status code.
//
// What one run cannot otherwise reach, because it only happens days later: a loan's instalment (the first is
// due a period after it is accepted, a day at the soonest) and so its default; a payout (earnings wait for
// the buyer's monthly bill and then a 14-day holdback); a refund of a paid bill; a purchase on the card
// (Stripe's authorization). B25.8: Lens (B25.7) brings each due now for a test workspace, with the
// synthetic key, and the last five scenarios below trade through them.
