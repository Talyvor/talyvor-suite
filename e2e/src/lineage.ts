// B32.65 — lineage and licences (Lens B32.24–B32.27), on Lens's API, once a run, on workspaces of its own.
//
// Three new authors build a family. A publishes an original whose remix licence asks a royalty of 20%. B accepts that
// licence (POST …/listings/{A}/remix), publishes its remix of A with A as its parent, and asks 10% of its own remixes. C
// accepts B's licence and publishes its remix of B, sold by a $20.00 30-day commercial rent. C's lineage must name B at
// 10% and A at 20%: the shares the licences locked. A fourth workspace rents C, which is one line on its bill, and uses C
// twice: each use is licensed, and the bill still holds that one line.
//
// The synthetic bill-pay pays the rent, and the sale's one journal entry (B32.26) must split it as the design does.
// Talyvor takes its fee — the price less SellerShare at the market take — and the rest is the pool: B receives its 10% of
// the pool, A its 20% of what B received, each rounded down, and C keeps the rest. On the design's worked example (a take
// of 15%) that is a fee of 3,000,000 µUSD, C 15,300,000, B 1,360,000 and A 340,000. Each author's earnings must hold
// exactly one row for the rent — C's the sale with its gross and the fee, B's and A's royalties of generation 1 and 2
// naming their own listing as the original — and each author's journal (holdback plus available, B32.17) must hold that
// row's amount and reconcile. The fee and the three rows sum to the price.
//
// The synthetic refund then refunds the paid bill, as Stripe's charge.refunded does, and the reversal (B32.27) must mirror
// the sale: every author's row reads refunded with its whole amount counted as refunded, every author's journal is back
// to 0 and reconciles, and the buyer's line reads refunded.
