// B30.109 — compliance (Lens B30.6, B30.17), on Lens's API, once a run, on a workspace of its own: a payment to a sanctioned
// name is blocked and opens a case, a payment to a name under review is held on its case, live money is refused while its
// capability is uncleared — and none of it posts.
//
// The owner accepts currency_accounts' terms and opens a GBP account on test money. Saving a TESTSANCTION payee is refused 403
// by screening, and the refusal names the compliance case the hit opened; a TESTPENDING payee is saved but held for review on a
// case of its own, and a payment to it is refused 403 naming that case. A live payment to a clean payee is refused naming live
// money, and a live EUR account is refused 403 naming currency_accounts' class, which takes no real money until Talyvor records
// a clearance. Then the GBP account must still hold 0 test and 0 live, no EUR account may exist and no payment row may have
// been made. With the operator read key, both cases are read on GET /v1/admin/screening: blocked and held, on this workspace.
