// B17.3 SELF-TEST — a stand-in for Lens (and the OIDC issuer the BFF discovers at boot), so the harness
// can be run end to end on one machine against the REAL BFF binary and the REAL web bundle.
//
// It keeps the contracts the harness and the app read: the synthetic routes (B17.1), the workspace
// read the BFF's synthetic sign-in checks (B17.2), session keys, the catalog, the ledger, and the
// streaming proxy with Lens's replay and pool headers. The "model" is arithmetic and a table of
// capitals — enough for every oracle to have something true to check.
//
// B17.8 adds what the Features page and the Try-it pages read and write: the workspace's settings,
// its guardrails and spending limits, Tare and document-conversion previews, and a document attached
// in Chat converted on the proxy.
//
// STUB_BREAK=<name> plants one defect, so a harness change can be seen to FAIL on it:
//   price       — answers report twice the tokens they were charged for
//   cross-replay — another account's identical question is replayed as "your earlier answer"
//   pii         — a question with personal data is cached and shared like any other
//   injection   — prompt-injection detection is on but lets everything through
//   distill     — a document attached in Chat is passed on unconverted
//   tare        — Tare's preview drops a field from the rows it keeps
//   conversion  — the conversion preview drops the document's paragraphs
//   budget      — a spending limit is recorded but never refuses
//   setting     — cost-optimised routing is answered as recorded but not kept
//   logging     — request logging "none" still keeps each answer, and serves the kept copy even when
//                 asked past the cache
//   agent-limit — an agent's limit per request is recorded but never refuses (B17.6, stub-bank.ts)
//   subscribe   — the test card is taken and Stripe sends the browser back, but no allowance is granted
//   royalty     — an answer served from the pool to another synthetic workspace mints its contributor nothing
//   roi-brand   — the ROI report wears the old navy and Inter, loads a font from another host, loses its
//                 mark and prints on a dark canvas (B29.29)
//   seats-allows — a plan's seat refusal names no plan that would allow the member (B32.71)
//   savings     — a replay does not say what it saved, as Lens before B28.95 (B28.358)
//   charge      — the stream says a model's answer was charged a µLXC more than its spend row (B28.362)
//   auto        — an "auto" answer is charged at the model Lens chose, but the stream names a dearer one (B28.363)
//   meter       — the balance read lags the ledger by 30 seconds, so Chat's meter does not drop by the charge (B28.104)
//   cheaper     — a question asked afresh of a provider's cheapest chat model, as Chat's "Re-ask with" asks it, is
//                 answered, named and charged by the provider's dearest (B28.364)
//   rooms       — a room is opened without its owner as a member, so it is in nobody's rooms (B32.53, stub-rooms.ts)
//   call-replay — an agent's byte-identical retry under one Idempotency-Key is charged again (B28.279)
//   hangup-unbilled — an agent's streamed answer is spent from it only once the stream ends, so one it hangs up on
//                 is never billed to it (B28.279)
//   move-replay, move-race — a fund or withdraw sent again under its key posts again; one landing beside another
//                 answers and posts nothing (B28.279, stub-bank.ts)
//   webhook-unsigned — Stripe's webhooks credit an event whatever its signature, or with none (B28.280)
//   webhook-stale — a signed event is taken however long ago it was signed (B28.280)
//   webhook-oversized — an event is read whole however big, so one past Lens's 1 MiB cap is taken (B28.280)
//   webhook-replay — an event delivered again, or its session under a new event, is credited again (B28.280)
//   rules-stream — a streamed request on an agent's key skips the agent's rules: its hours, models, providers and limits (B28.281)
//   pool-unshared — an answer goes into the pool whatever its workspace's sharing switch says (B28.283)
//   share-revoke — a shared chat's link turned off leaves the list, and its copy is still read by anyone holding it (B28.127)
//   pool-tells  — a question another workspace has asked is answered afresh, but says so in a pool header (B28.283)
//   pool-negation — the pool also serves a question asked with the same words in another order, or with a "not" (B28.283)
//   tool-fetch  — a tool fetches an address its arguments name, as one following a webhook or a callback would (B28.284)
//   tool-key    — a tool's answer carries the key it was called with (B28.284)
//   ssrf        — a compute node and the audit webhook are dialled wherever they point, the metadata address answering (B28.285)
//   zip-bomb    — a .docx's document is unpacked however large it gets (B28.285)
//   doc-size    — a document of any size is taken for conversion (B28.285)
//   key-forward — a plain request's X-Talyvor-Key and X-API-Key go on to the vLLM upstream (B28.287)
//   key-forward-stream — a streamed request goes on to the vLLM upstream with every header it came with, its key too (B28.287)
//   key-listed  — the workspace's list of API keys shows each key whole (B28.287)
//   ratelimit-open — the rate limiter lets every request through, as Lens's does when Redis errors and it fails open (B28.288)
//   retry-after — a request the rate limiter refuses is answered 429 without Retry-After (B28.288)
//   ws-limits-ignored — a workspace an operator gave limits of its own is held to the defaults all the same (B39.35)
//   ratelimit-open-later — the rate limiter holds for the first workspace that bursts it and lets every one after through,
//                 as Lens's does once Redis starts erroring after the night's own run (B28.292: only the deep pass FAILs)
//   web-search  — Search the web is ignored: nothing is searched, and an answer cites no page (B28.372)
//   run-code    — Run code is ignored: no code is run, and the model answers from what it knows (B28.373)
//   temporary-kept — a temporary chat's answer (X-Talyvor-Cache-Store: off) is kept to serve again, as any other (B28.131)
//   pool-off-shared — a chat kept out of the shared pool (X-Talyvor-Pool: off) has its answer pooled for other workspaces (B28.381)
//   file-delete — an uploaded file's DELETE answers 204 and keeps it: still listed, its id still there (B28.380)
//   connector   — offered a connector's fingerprint tool, the stand-in model makes a fingerprint up rather than calling it (B28.122)
//   docs-page   — a Docs page attached in Chat is not read: asked to quote it, the stand-in model says it sees no page (B28.375)
//   issue       — a request's X-Talyvor-Issue is not kept: its spend names no issue, so no Track issue's AI cost rises (B28.376)
//   schedule-early — a scheduled prompt is asked as soon as it is scheduled, not at the time set (B28.377)
//   schedule-free  — a scheduled prompt is answered with nothing on the paying agent's statement (B28.377)
//   openapi-wallets — /openapi.json, / and /status are as before B28.12: no Agent Wallets line, tag or operation, and /
//                 links no API reference (stub-openapi.ts)
//   rails-outage — /status.json's screening rail failed after its last success, so it reads outage (B30.124)
//   status-truth — /healthz reads degraded while /status.json reads operational (B37.7)
//   pool-stale  — the pool keeps every answer with its first number 210 short, as the "9792" for 6235 + 3767 that
//                 agent-pause-all was replayed from 9 Oct on (B28.459): only a question asked past the cache is right
//   reconciliation-missing — yesterday's pounds run has a payment the partner's statement does not show, and the £7.00
//                 shortfall it leaves in the safeguarding view (B30.123)
//
// B17.6 adds the Agent Bank and the marketplace (stub-bank.ts): agents with keys of their own, whose
// requests through the proxy are judged by their rules and spent from their own balance.
//
// B17.10 adds plans and royalties as Lens has them for synthetic workspaces since B25.2: subscribing
// sends the browser to a stand-in for Stripe's hosted checkout (/stub-checkout/…, with Stripe's field
// ids), where test card 4242 grants the period's allowance and returns to the app; and a pooled serve
// credits its contributor a pool_royalty_held row on the earnings ledger (tokens/history).
//
// B25.4 adds money between owners and the marketplace's moderators, with their planted defects
// (stub-bank.ts): the review queue answers the moderator key in STUB_MODERATOR_KEY, Lens's minute tick
// runs every two seconds, and Stripe's Connect onboarding is a page at /stub-connect/….
//
// B26.24: every read the self-test makes is answered in the shape a real Lens answers it, held to
// lens-shapes.json by test/stubLens.test.ts. A route this stub does not know is a 404 it logs as
// "stub lens: no such route", which the self-test names — never a `{}` that a screen then throws on.
