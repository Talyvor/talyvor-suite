// B17.6 SELF-TEST — the stand-in Lens's Agent Bank (B19) and marketplace (B20), as much of each as
// Agent Wallets, the marketplace screens and the bank scenarios read and write: agents and their keys,
// funding, rules, approvals, pausing, payments inside a company and to another company's agent, the
// double-entry postings and the statements built from them; listings, uses, the buyer's bill and the
// seller's earnings. A bill is never paid here, so earnings stay pending, as a synthetic company's do.
//
// STUB_BREAK=agent-limit plants the defect the bank's DONE names: an agent's limit per request is
// recorded but never refuses.
//
// B25.4 adds money between owners (B22) and the marketplace's review, reports, takedowns and payouts,
// as B25.3 made each work for test users: transfers, refunds and requests between two companies' agents,
// loans, escrow, pots, recurring transfers and cash-outs (the last two paid by tick(), as Lens's minute
// tick pays them), agent cards, listings held for review, the moderators' queue behind a moderator key,
// and a seller's Stripe account. STUB_BREAK may name several of these, comma-separated, one per scenario:
//   send-one-side       — a send leaves the sender but never reaches the other company's agent
//   refund-kept         — giving a transfer back takes it from the receiver and never returns it to the sender
//   request-unpaid      — accepting a request marks it accepted and pays nothing
//   loan-no-payout      — accepting a loan makes it active without paying the borrower
//   escrow-open-free    — paying into escrow takes nothing from the payer
//   escrow-release-lost — confirming delivery releases the escrow to nobody
//   escrow-dispute-pays — disputing an escrow pays the payee anyway
//   pot-out-lost        — moving credits out of a pot empties it into nothing
//   schedule-twice      — each run of a recurring transfer pays twice
//   cash-out-free       — a cash-out is paid without holding the credits from the agent
//   card-live           — an agent's card is issued in live mode
//   review-public       — a listing held for review is in the public catalog
//   approve-noop        — a moderator's approval answers but leaves the listing held
//   report-lost         — a report is acknowledged and never reaches the moderators' queue
//   takedown-no-refund  — taking a listing down refunds nobody
//   connect-none        — Connect with Stripe sends the browser to Stripe but records no account
//   secret-published    — B28.282: a listing carrying a secret is published like any other
//   self-use-billed     — B28.282: a seller's use of their own listing is billed, and earns them its price
//   b30-capability-gone — fx, one of B30.1's money-and-markets capabilities, is missing from the list (B30.115)
//   level-needed-wrong  — payments_out is listed as needing L0 for live money, not L2 (B30.117)
//   cross-company-live  — B28.290: money between two companies is real money: no test money on the transfer, its ledger rows funded live
//
// B25.8 adds what Lens (B25.7) brings due for a test workspace with the synthetic key: a loan's instalment
// (taken or missed by tick(), as Lens's minute tick does), a buyer's bill paid and refunded, a purchase on
// an agent's card; and a seller taking their earnings as credits. Its defects, one per scenario:
//   loan-repay-lost     — an instalment is taken from the borrower and never reaches the lender
//   loan-default-never  — a late loan missed again stays late, never in default
//   card-free           — an approved card purchase takes nothing from the agent
//   payout-uncredited   — taking earnings as credits records the payout and credits nothing
//   bill-refund-kept    — refunding a paid bill marks the buyer's use refunded and leaves the seller's earning
//
// B32.75 adds the seller's marketplace journal (Lens B32.17, GET …/marketplace/journal): a paid use's share waits in
// the journal's holdback, due at once, until tick() releases it to available, as Lens's release job does. Its defects:
//   journal-off           — a released share reads one µUSD short on the journal, though it still says it reconciles
//   journal-unreconciled  — the journal says it does not reconcile
//
// B32.76 adds a listing published with its offers, one active per kind and licence and each saying what its licence
// allows, its price per use following its per_use commercial offer (Lens B32.18). Its defects:
//   offers-duplicate      — a second commercial rent beside the first is accepted
//   offer-price-stale     — raising the per_use price leaves the next use billed at the old one
//   offer-price-backdated — the bill reads every use of a listing at the listing's price now
//
// B32.78 adds the uses a licence covers (Lens B32.19): while a rent, buy or subscription is active, a use of its listing
// is charged licensed at nothing and counted in its uses_covered; a personal licence never covers an agent's key. Its
// defects:
//   licence-replay-buys   — the same Idempotency-Key sent again buys a second licence, and a second line on the bill
//   licence-use-billed    — a use the licence covers is billed at the per-use price as if there were none
//   licence-covers-agent  — a personal licence covers an agent key's use too
//
// B32.80 adds an agent's licences judged by its rules (Lens B32.22): a licence taken with an agent's key is refused naming
// max_commitment_ulxc above the most one licence may commit it to, and naming may_subscribe for a subscription it may not
// take; above its approval amount an approval is filed, and once approved the licence goes through once. Its defects:
//   commitment-unjudged     — a licence above max_commitment_ulxc goes through
//   subscribe-unjudged      — a subscription goes through without may_subscribe
//   licence-refused-kept    — a refused licence answers 403, but the licence and its line on the bill are written anyway
//   approval-buys-twice     — an approved licence goes through, and the approval stays approved for the next
//
// B32.79 adds free trial uses (Lens B32.21): a per_use commercial offer's trial_uses (at most 5) makes each buyer's first
// uses of its listing trials — charged trial at nothing, answering trial with the trial uses left and what it would have
// cost, never on the bill and never an earning. Its defects:
//   trial-billed   — a trial answers as one, but the use is on the buyer's bill at the offer's price
//   trial-earns    — paying the bill pays the seller its share of each trial use too
//   trial-endless  — the trial uses never run out: the use after the last is a trial as well
//
// B28.360 adds freezing an agent's card (POST …/card/freeze and …/card/unfreeze, for Lens's B28.97): a purchase on a
// frozen card is declined and nothing leaves the agent. Its defect:
//   freeze-ignored      — a frozen card answers frozen, and a purchase on it is still approved
//
// B28.279 adds what Lens B17.26 does with a fund or withdraw's Idempotency-Key: it is the entry's ref, and a move whose
// key already posted answers the agent's balance and posts nothing. Its defects:
//   move-replay         — a move sent again under its key posts again
//   move-race           — a withdrawal that lands while another move of the same agent is in flight answers 200 and posts nothing
//
// B32.66 adds tax and weekly payouts (Lens B32.39–B32.42, stub-tax.ts): each billed use's tax on the bill, Talyvor's receipt
// for each paid bill, the seller's weekly statements, and the synthetic payout run of talyvor-lens B32.99, which withholds a
// seller with earnings and no tax details and pays one whose details are complete. Its defect, beside stub-tax.ts's two:
//   payout-hold-ignored — the payout run pays a seller who gave no tax details
//
// B28.426 adds a Chat question asked through a listing (X-Talyvor-Listing, talyvor-lens B28.186): one use of it, charged as a
// marketplace use, the answer saying how (X-Talyvor-Listing-Charge). Its defect:
//   chat-listing-unbilled — a question asked through a paid listing answers billed, and nothing goes on the buyer's bill
//
// B32.96 adds a seller's statements as only its owner or an admin reads them, and the payout page's paid_this_week. Its defects:
//   statement-unsummed  — a paid week's statement leaves its Stripe fees out of its lines, its net still the payout's
//   statement-list-gross — the list of statements gives a paid week's net as its payout's gross
//   statement-agent     — an agent's key reads its workspace's statements
//
// B32.97 adds a self-billing seller's payout issuing their self-billed invoice (Lens B32.43), as production issues it while
// LENS_SELF_BILLING_VAT is off — under review, no VAT — and the week's statement carrying it with its supply_vat line. Its defects:
//   self-bill-missing    — a payout to a seller who agreed to self-billing issues no invoice
//   self-bill-vat-paid   — under review, the invoice charges the GB rate and the payout pays it
//   self-bill-vat-differs — the payout pays the GB rate while its invoice reads no VAT
//   self-bill-unagreed   — a seller who never agreed to self-billing is self-billed
//
// B32.98 adds the annual platform-reporting export (Lens B32.44, POST and GET /v1/admin/platform-reports) on the global admin
// key alone: one record per seller resident in the UK or an EU member state and activity, its consideration what the year's
// clears credited the seller's holdback less what refunds reversed, no tax withheld, and each file's run recorded with its
// sha256. Its defects:
//   report-lists-us            — a seller resident outside the UK and the EU is listed too
//   report-leaves-gb           — a seller resident in the UK is left out
//   report-consideration-gross — a sale's consideration is its price before Talyvor's fee, not what the seller was credited
//   report-sha-unrecorded      — the run is recorded with a sha256 that is not the file's
//
// B32.89 adds the trust panel (Lens B32.49, stub-trust.ts): a paying buyer's review and the seller's reply, the trust read
// and market_listing's trust over MCP, and talyvor-lens B32.102's synthetic card link. Its defects are stub-trust.ts's.
//
// B32.65 adds a remix's sale paying its originals (Lens B32.26): a cleared use writes one row per payee — the seller's
// sale, and a royalty for each ancestor up the listing's lineage — and a refund reverses every one (B32.27). Its defects:
//   lineage-one-generation — the royalty stops at the listing's parents: a grandparent earns nothing
//   lineage-refund-kept    — refunding a paid bill reverses the seller's row and leaves the originals' royalties
//
// B28.162 adds a listing's versions: each keeps its artifact and changelog, and a use runs the version it names. Its defect:
//   version-pin-ignored — a use runs the listing's latest version whatever version it names
// B17.203: not a defect but Lens's B32.46 copy check, as every night's production run meets it on market-remix-licence:
//   version-held — a new version holds its listing for review, as one near-identical to another night's listing is held
// B17.262: not a defect but Lens's B17.206 held version, as every night's production run meets it on market-versions:
//   version-2-held — a new version is held for review while the one before it stays live, until a moderator approves it
//
// B32.93 adds two defects of a bill's tax (Lens B32.39), beside stub-tax.ts's tax-reverse-charged:
//   bill-gross-untaxed — the bill's gross is its net, the tax left out
//   clear-tax-dropped  — a paid use's clear entry takes none of its tax to tax:<XX>, so the seller's week collects no VAT
//
// B28.385 adds the bill by Stripe invoice (talyvor-lens B28.140): each synthetic bill-pay is an invoice whose billing period
// runs from the last one's end to its payment, listed newest first after the period in progress ("upcoming"), with its PDF
// and what it charged and refunded; ?invoice= reads the uses one invoice carried. Its defects:
//   invoice-refund-paid — an invoice's bill reads a refunded use paid, and counts it in the total
//   invoice-by-month    — the bill read for an invoice holds the calendar month's uses, not the invoice's
//   invoice-total-off   — an invoice's gross leaves its tax out
