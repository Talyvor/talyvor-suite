// B30.122 SELF-TEST — the stand-in Lens's terms for each capability (Lens B30.9), as capability-terms reads and accepts them:
// GET …/terms (every capability with terms, its latest version and whether the workspace accepted it), GET …/terms/{capability}
// (with its text) and POST …/terms/{capability}/accept {"version": n} — 201 with the acceptance, 409 for a version that is not
// the latest. Every B30 capability has version 1 of a text headed "Draft — for legal review". Its defect:
//   terms-fx-accepted    — a new workspace's list reads fx as already accepted
//   terms-accept-ignored — an acceptance is answered 201 and recorded nowhere, so the capability still asks (B30.103)
