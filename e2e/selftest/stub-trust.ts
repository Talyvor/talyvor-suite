// B32.89 SELF-TEST — the stand-in Lens's trust panel (Lens B32.49), as market-trust reads and writes it: a buyer's review
// of a listing (PUT …/marketplace/listings/{id}/review), the seller's reply (PUT …/reviews/{reviewID}/reply), the trust
// read (GET /v1/marketplace/listings/{id}/trust, and market_listing's trust over MCP), and the synthetic card link of
// talyvor-lens B32.102 (POST /v1/synthetic/workspaces/{ws}/card-link), which records one card on two test workspaces as
// though both had paid with it. Only a buyer with a billed use of the listing that was not refunded, and no card in common
// with its seller, may review it, and only such buyers' reviews are counted — asked at every read, as Lens asks. The Bank
// (stub-bank.ts) holds the listings and the uses; this desk keeps the reviews and the cards. Its defects:
//   review-refused-kept — a buyer who never paid is refused 403, but its review is written anyway, and counts once it pays
//   review-linked       — a buyer sharing a card with the seller may review, though its use was free, and is counted
//   linked-billed       — a buyer sharing a card with the seller is billed for a use, not charged linked (Bank's use route)
//   trust-mcp-unreplied — market_listing's trust leaves the seller's replies out
//   card-link-missing   — no synthetic card link, as on a Lens without B32.102: 404, which market-trust FAILs
