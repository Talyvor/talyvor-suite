// tenant.go — the tenancy boundary. Everything that decides WHICH Lens workspace a request
// touches lives here, and nowhere else.
//
// Before this, the eight workspace-scoped upstream paths were built once at route-registration
// time from a single configured id, so every signed-in person shared one workspace: one balance,
// one key set, one ledger, one cache. Ten trial users were one account with ten people in it.
//
// Now: on login the BFF calls Lens's POST /v1/provision with the session's identity, and Lens
// derives the workspace id and mints a workspace-scoped JWT for it. The BFF caches that tuple in
// the SERVER-SIDE session and builds every upstream path from it, per request.
//
// TWO PROPERTIES CARRY THE WEIGHT:
//
//  1. The BFF never names a workspace. It sends an identity; Lens decides which workspace that
//     is (workspace_id = "u"+base32(sha256(identity))). So no bug here — not a stray header, not
//     a mis-parsed body — can aim at another tenant. The id is only ever read back out of the
//     session, never accepted from a client.
//  2. The BFF holds LENS_PROVISION_SECRET, never LENS_API_KEY. The admin key would make
//     workspaceAuthorized true for every workspace and unlock ~30 admin routes; a BFF compromise
//     would escalate from one tenant's data to control of every tenant. The provisioning secret
//     can create a workspace and mint a session token for it, and nothing else.

//
// ── THE HOLE IT CLOSES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The workspace token is minted for sessionTokenTTLHours (8). The SESSION lasts BFF_SESSION_TTL
// (12 by default). Nobody reconciled those numbers, and lensTokenExp — the field that records
// when the token dies — was written at login and read by NOTHING. So hours 8→12 of every session
// were spent holding a dead credential: /auth/me still says authenticated (the session is fine),
// the gate correctly renders the app, and every workspace-scoped read comes back 401. That is
// the same screen the Lens restart produced, arriving on a timer, for everyone, every day.
//
// A field written and never read is the difference between a bug that is fixed and one that is
// merely knowable.
//
// ── WHY RE-PROVISIONING IS THE RIGHT REFRESH ─────────────────────────────────
//
// POST /v1/provision is idempotent on identity: Lens derives the workspace from (issuer, sub),
// so this returns the SAME workspace with a fresh token — there is no separate refresh endpoint
// to add, and no second code path that could drift from the login path. It states no pooling
// preference (provisionForSession), so a re-mint cannot disturb consent Lens already recorded.
//
// ── WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A token that is INSIDE its lifetime but invalid anyway — Lens restarting with a new ephemeral
// signing key, a rotated secret — is not visible to any clock. No proactive check can catch it,
// which is why the screen still has to be honest about a 401 (components/SessionExpiredBar.tsx).
// This closes the half that is predictable; it does not pretend to close the other half.
//
// A failure to re-mint is NOT an error path: the old token is kept and the request proceeds to
// fail upstream as it would have anyway. Turning a refresh blip into a hard failure would make
// this change strictly worse than the bug it fixes.
func (a *app) refreshWorkspaceToken(ctx context.Context, sid string, s session) session {
