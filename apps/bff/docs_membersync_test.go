// THE FIRST-VISIT WINDOW ON DOCS, asserted at the BFF.
//
// Docs no longer deadlocks — it enumerates workspaces from Track rather than from the workspaces
// it already holds content for (talyvor-track bf60842, talyvor-docs c970329), so a brand-new
// identity's workspace is visible to Docs the moment Track mints it. What was left is a TIMING
// window, not a deadlock: Docs learns the ROSTER on a periodic sweep, so between signing up and
// the next sweep a person has a workspace Docs can see and a membership Docs has not read yet,
// and every write 403s. Shortening the sweep narrows the window; it does not close it, because
// "narrower" is still "sometimes".
//
// So the BFF NUDGES: at login, right after Track mints the workspace, it asks Docs to reconcile
// that one workspace now. The sweep stays as the backstop — the nudge is an optimisation of WHEN,
// never the only path, which is what keeps a missed nudge a delay rather than a permanent 403.
//
// ⚠ THE TWO RULES ARE TRACK'S, FOR TRACK'S REASON, and they bind harder here: this is a
// convenience on a product that already works eventually.
//
//  1. A DOCS FAILURE MUST NOT FAIL LOGIN. Losing Lens, billing, keys and Track because Docs was
//     briefly unreachable, in exchange for a window the sweep closes by itself within minutes,
//     is a plainly bad trade.
//  2. IT MUST NOT BE CACHED IN THE SESSION. There is deliberately nothing session-shaped to
//     cache: the nudge returns no value the BFF keeps. A session that recorded "nudged" would
//     freeze one failed attempt for twelve hours; a session that recorded "not nudged" would be
//     a retry the sweep already performs. The absence of a field is the mechanism.
