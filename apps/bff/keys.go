// The BFF's first write path: minting a workspace API key. Two disciplines live
// here, argued rather than assumed:
//
// CSRF. The session cookie is __Host-/Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite=Lax. Lax
// withholds it from cross-SITE POSTs — most of CSRF — but SameSite groups every
// *.talyvor.com sibling into ONE site, so a compromised or future sibling
// subdomain could still forge a credential-minting POST with the cookie
// attached. The added layer is a strict Origin check: browsers attach Origin to
// every POST and scripts cannot forge it, so requiring Origin == the configured
// public origin (fail-closed when absent) exactly closes the same-site gap and
// the legacy-browser gap, statelessly. A synchronizer token was considered and
// rejected: everything a token defends against in a browser, Origin already
// covers here (a token earns its machinery when Origin can be absent on
// legitimate traffic — proxies we don't control — which is not this
// deployment: our own Caddy fronts the only public path). Reads stay GET-only,
// so Lax's cross-site-GET allowance stays harmless.
//
// THE RESPONSE CARRIES A SECRET, exactly once, on purpose. The blanket
// never-leaks sweeps stay fully strict everywhere else (this route's POST is
// simply not in their GET sweep lists); the tight guarantees for this one
// response are: Cache-Control: no-store (no cache layer may retain it), the
// BFF never logs the body (the one log line here is transport-error-only), and
// the key appears in no other response — the list serves prefixes.
