// leaksweep_population_test.go — THE POPULATION A LEAK SWEEP RUNS OVER MUST COME FROM THE
// ROUTER, NOT FROM A LIST WRITTEN BESIDE IT.
//
// ── THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// secretleak_test.go fixed the NEEDLES — what a sweep searches for. It did not touch the
// POPULATION — which responses it searches. Three sweeps in three files each carry their
// own hand-written endpoint list:
//
//	bff_test.go#TestKeyNeverReachesResponse         14 entries, and its comment claims the
//	                                                guarantee holds "on any /api endpoint"
//	products_test.go#TestGatewaySecretsNeverReachResponse   20 entries + /auth/me
//	auth_test.go#TestKeyNeverReachesResponseOIDC     8 entries, a subset + /auth/me
//
// MEASURED at 5943e92 by driving GET against every pattern mountedPatterns() finds, rather
// than by reading the three lists: 40 mounted patterns, 30 of them /api/* that answer GET
// with something other than 405. The three lists cover 21 of those 30. NINE ARE SWEPT BY
// NOTHING: the six /api/admin/* routes, /api/distill, /api/lens/convert-quote and
// /api/version.
//
// ⚠ AND THE BLINDNESS IS LIVE, NOT LATENT — POSITIVE-CONTROLLED, VERDICTS READ FROM
// `--- FAIL:` LINES OVER THE WHOLE PACKAGE (~/talyvor-queue/w11-leaksweep-controls-8d51.py):
//
//	S1  the provisioning secret echoed into GET /api/lxc/topup-options' BODY (a SWEPT route)
//	    → CAUGHT, by TestKeyNeverReachesResponse. The sweep is armed and works.
//	U1  THE SAME SECRET concatenated into GET /api/lens/convert-quote's BODY — a 200 on a
//	    requireTenant MONEY route → NOT CAUGHT. 350 tests ran; none failed.
//	U2  the same secret written into a GET /api/version response HEADER → NOT CAUGHT.
//
// ⚠ THE QUEUE'S NOTE ON THIS WAS RIGHT IN KIND AND WRONG IN DETAIL, so the correction is
// recorded rather than quietly dropped: it named `/api/distill` AND `/api/pooling` as the
// two absentees. /api/pooling ANSWERS 405 TO GET — it is a POST-only write route, swept by
// the Origin family in sameorigin_test.go, and a GET sweep has no response of its own to
// search. The absentee count was 2 read off two lists; driven against the router it is 9.
//
// ⚠⚠ AND "SWEPT BY THE ORIGIN FAMILY" WAS THE NEXT HOLE, BECAUSE IT ANSWERS A DIFFERENT
// QUESTION. sameorigin_test.go asks whether a write REFUSES a foreign Origin. It never looks
// at what a write ANSWERS. So every sentence above that excused a route for being write-only
// was excusing it from a sweep it was never in — see TestLeakSweep_CoversEveryMountedWriteRoute
// below, which is the other half and was measured to be missing at a1bf848.
//
// ── WHY THIS IS NOT "ADD NINE LINES TO THE LIST" ─────────────────────────────
//
// Adding them fixes today's nine and leaves the shape: the tenth route mounted tomorrow is
// unswept in exactly the same silent way, and all three lists still read as coverage. So
// this test takes its population FROM mountedPatterns() and sweeps whatever the router
// actually serves. There is no list here to go stale — a new GET route is swept the moment
// it is mounted, and that is asserted below rather than asserted in this comment.
//
// The three existing sweeps are left where they are: each asserts something extra about its
// own fixture (that the upstream RECEIVED the credential, that the gateway proofs went out)
// which this population check does not, and deleting them would trade a real assertion for
// tidiness.

// TestLeakSweep_CoversEveryMountedGETRoute drives GET at every mounted /api pattern, in three
// fixtures, and asserts no secret the app holds reaches the body or any header of any of them.
//
// ⚠ THREE FIXTURES BECAUSE ONE CANNOT SERVE THE POPULATION. newTestApp holds only the
// provisioning secret and answers 503 on every product route (Track/Docs unconfigured);
// productApp configures both, so those routes return a real upstream payload AND the app holds
// two more needles; operatorApp is the only one whose session passes requireOperator.
//
// ⚠ AND THE OPERATOR FIXTURE IS HERE BECAUSE THIS TEST WAS VACUOUS ON SIX ROUTES WITHOUT IT —
// FOUND BY A CONTROL, NOT BY READING. With two fixtures the six /api/admin/* routes were
// "swept": the sweep drove them and searched the bytes that came back. But requireOperator
// refuses at 401/403 BEFORE any handler runs, so those bytes were the refusal, and a control
// that leaked the provisioning secret out of `adminNotWired`'s own body came back NOT CAUGHT
// while this test stayed green. Driving a route is not reaching it.

	// ⚠ THE UPPER BOUND IS THE OTHER HALF, and without it the floor is escapable. A route that

	// coverage shrinks. ELEVEN are write-only today, and each of them is NAMED AND JUSTIFIED in the
	// numbered notes below — the fifth through the eleventh, the first four being the ones this
	// bound was born with (/api/keys/{id}, /api/lens/convert, /api/lxc/checkout, /api/pooling). A
	// twelfth is a change in what this guard can see, and it has to be looked at. Their WRITE
	// responses are searched by the write sweep below — for the year this bound existed the excuse
	// was "the Origin sweep covers them", and it did not.
	//
	// ⚠ THIS PARAGRAPH USED TO RESTATE THE LIST AND THE COUNT, AND BOTH HAD GONE FALSE: it said
	// "SIX are write-only today" and named six while the bound below was 10 and the population was
	// 10. A count and a list written twice are two things that can disagree, and these did — so
	// the second copy is gone rather than corrected. The notes below are the list.
	//
	// ⚠ THE FIFTH, /api/docs/ai/ask, WAS LOOKED AT RATHER THAN WAVED THROUGH. It is POST-only
	// because an ask has a body and no idempotent reading — GET would have to carry the question
	// in a query string, where it would land in every access log. It is NOT outside the sweep:
	// the write half below derives its population from mountedPatterns(), so it drives POST at
	// this route in all three fixtures and searches what comes back, including the Docs upstream
	// bytes the productApp fixture streams.
	//
	// ⚠ THE SIXTH, /api/docs/pages/{pageID}/summarize, WAS LOOKED AT ON THE SAME TERMS AND FOR A
	// STRONGER REASON THAN ASK'S. It is POST-only because the thing it sends is a whole page of
	// text: as a GET that body would have to be a query string, which means a customer's document
	// in every access log and proxy buffer along the way — the leak this file exists to hunt,
	// created by the shape of the route rather than by anything in a response. It is METERED, so
	// it is also not idempotent in the way a GET promises: each call is a Lens completion the
	// workspace pays for and Docs attributes to that page. Like ask, it is inside the write half
	// below, which drives POST at every mounted pattern in all three fixtures.
	// ⚠ THE SEVENTH, /api/docs/pages/{pageID}/translate, WAS LOOKED AT ON THE SAME TERMS AS
	// SUMMARISE'S AND FOR THE SAME REASON. It sends a whole page of text, so as a GET that body
	// would be a query string — a customer's document in every access log and proxy buffer on the
	// way, which is the leak this file hunts, created by the shape of the route rather than by
	// anything in a response. It is METERED too: each call is a Lens completion the workspace pays
	// for and Docs attributes to the named page, so it is not idempotent in the way a GET promises.
	// Its POST response is searched by the write half below.
	//
	// ⚠ THE EIGHTH, /api/docs/spaces/{spaceID}/pages/{pageID}/changelog/generate, WAS LOOKED AT
	// AND ITS REASON IS THE ONE THE SEVEN ABOVE DO NOT HAVE. The other seven are POST-only
	// because of what they CARRY (a question, a document) or what they SPEND. This one is
	// POST-only because of what it LEAVES BEHIND: measured against talyvor-docs' own route on
	// real Postgres, every call INSERTs a changelog_entries row, and a later `…/publish` puts
	// that row into the workspace's public RSS feed. A GET that writes a durable, publishable row
	// is the one thing a GET may never be — it would be retried by any proxy, prefetched by any
	// browser, and re-run by any crawler, each time leaving another release note behind. It also
	// carries a list of issue ids, which as a query string would put a workspace's unreleased
	// issue keys in every access log. Its POST response is searched by the write half below.
	//
	// ⚠ THE NINTH, /api/track/issues/{id}/find-duplicates, IS POST-ONLY BECAUSE UPSTREAM MOUNTS
	// IT THAT WAY AND BECAUSE IT SPENDS. talyvor-track mounts `POST
	// /v1/workspaces/{wsID}/issues/{id}/find-duplicates` (internal/ai/handler.go Mount), so a GET
	// here would have nowhere honest to go. It carries NOTHING — no body, no query, measured: the
	// upstream handler decodes neither — so unlike ask/summarise/translate there is no payload
	// that a query string would leak. What makes a GET wrong is the METER: each press is a Lens
	// completion the workspace pays for and Track attributes to this issue (measured: the request
	// reaching Lens carries `X-Talyvor-Feature: <the issue's identifier>`), and a GET that spends
	// is retried by proxies, prefetched by browsers and re-run by crawlers, each time billing
	// someone. Its POST response is searched by the write half below, in all three fixtures.
	// ⚠ THE TENTH, /api/track/issues/{id}/triage, IS POST-ONLY FOR THE NINTH'S REASON PLUS ONE THE
	// OTHER NINE DO NOT HAVE. talyvor-track mounts `POST /v1/workspaces/{wsID}/issues/{id}/triage`
	// and each press is a `claude-haiku-4-6` completion the workspace pays for and Track attributes
	// to this issue (measured: `X-Talyvor-Feature: <the issue's identifier>`), so a GET that spends
	// would be retried by proxies, prefetched by browsers and re-run by crawlers, each time billing
	// someone. THE EXTRA REASON IS WHAT UPSTREAM DOES WITH A QUERY STRING: `?apply=true` makes
	// Triage OVERWRITE the issue's priority and labels with the model's suggestion, discarding the
	// write error. This BFF forwards NO query, so that is unreachable here — but a GET is the verb a
	// browser follows from a link, and the one thing this route must never look like is safe to
	// prefetch. It carries NOTHING (no body, no query, measured: the upstream handler decodes
	// neither), so there is no payload a query string would leak. Its POST response is searched by
	// the write half below.
	// ⚠ THE ELEVENTH, /api/docs/pages/{pageID}/suggest-title, WAS LOOKED AT ON SUMMARISE'S AND
	// TRANSLATE'S TERMS, WHICH IT SHARES EXACTLY. It sends a whole page of stored text, so as a GET
	// that body would have to be a query string — a customer's document in every access log and
	// proxy buffer along the way, which is the leak this file hunts, created by the shape of the
	// route rather than by anything in a response. It is METERED: each call is a Lens completion
	// the workspace pays for and Docs attributes to the named page under the feature tag
	// `docs-ai-title` (measured against docs' real handler over a counting fake Lens — every body
	// it was given, including three that carry no readable content, produced one completion). And
	// upstream mounts it POST-only (`POST /workspaces/{wsID}/ai/suggest-title`), so a GET here
	// would have nowhere honest to go. ⚠ WHAT IT DOES NOT DO IS LEAVE A ROW BEHIND: unlike the
	// changelog route above, the suggestion is returned and nothing is written — applying it is a
	// separate PATCH on the page route, which answers GET and is inside the sweep. Its POST
	// response is searched by the write half below, in all three fixtures.
	// ⚠ THE TWELFTH, /api/ai/stream/{provider}/{rest...}, IS POST-ONLY AND ITS REASON IS THE
	// STRONGEST IN THIS LIST. It is a model completion the workspace pays for, with a
	// CALLER-CHOSEN prompt and a caller-chosen model, so a GET would be prefetched by browsers,
	// retried by proxies and re-run by crawlers — each time spending someone's balance on an
	// arbitrary request. And the prompt is the BODY: as a GET it would have to travel as a query
	// string, putting whatever the user typed into every access log and proxy buffer on the path,
	// which is precisely the leak this file hunts, created by the shape of the route.
	// ⚠ WHAT IT RETURNS CARRIES NO BFF-ORIGINATED SECRET, checked rather than assumed: the handler
	// copies the upstream Content-Type and relays the upstream body verbatim, and the only
	// credential it holds — the narrow session key — travels in a REQUEST header (stream.go). It
	// adds no field of its own to the response at all.
	//
	// THE THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH, /api/docs/pages/{pageID}/rewrite and /write (B2.3), ARE
	// POST-ONLY FOR SUMMARIZE'S REASON: a metered completion on caller-supplied text, so a GET would
	// re-spend on every prefetch and put the writer's words in a query string. Each relays Docs'
	// `{"text": …}` body verbatim and adds nothing of its own.
	//
	// THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH, /api/features/tare and /api/features/cost-optimize-routing (B8.2),
	// ARE POLICY WRITES: their state is READ on GET /api/features, which the sweep reaches. Each
	// answers only the one field Lens recorded.
	//
	// THE SEVENTEENTH, /api/features/distill-poolable (B11.2), IS THE SAME KIND: the shared-
	// conversions consent, read back through GET /api/features as distill_poolable.
	//
	// THE EIGHTEENTH, /api/billing/subscribe (B13.3), IS /api/lxc/checkout'S KIND: it starts a
	// Stripe Checkout, so a GET would open a payable session on a prefetch. Its answer is the
	// session URL and nothing the BFF holds.
	//
	// THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH, /api/features/tare/preview and /api/features/conversion/preview
	// (B11.3), ARE POST-ONLY BECAUSE THEIR INPUT IS THE BODY: a pasted tool output or an uploaded
	// document, which a GET would put in a query string. Each relays Lens's preview answer verbatim
	// (or its 4xx reason) and adds nothing the BFF holds.
	//
	// THE TWENTY-FIRST AND TWENTY-SECOND, /api/features/guardrails and /api/features/logging (B18.22),
	// ARE /api/features/tare'S KIND: a switch whose state is read back through GET /api/features
	// (guardrails, logging_policy); each answers only what Lens recorded.
	//
	// /api/features/pattern-mining (B18.55) IS THE SAME KIND: its state is read back through GET
	// /api/features as pattern_mining; it answers only what Lens reads back.
	//
	// /api/ai/feedback (B23.12) IS POST ONLY BECAUSE IT DELETES: Lens removes the stored answer the
	// request id names. It answers Lens's counts of what went and adds nothing the BFF holds.
	//
	// THE TWENTY-THIRD AND TWENTY-FOURTH, DELETE /api/track/workspaces/{id} and POST
	// /api/track/workspaces/{id}/restore (B18.53), ARE WRITES WHOSE STATE IS READ BACK THROUGH GETs
	// THE SWEEP ALREADY REACHES — /api/track/workspaces and /api/track/workspaces/deleted. Each relays
	// Track's own answer (the workspace, or its refusal) and adds nothing the BFF holds.
	//
	// THE TWENTY-FIFTH, /api/docs/spaces/{spaceID}/pages/{pageID}/pin (B18.27), IS PUT AND DELETE ONLY:
	// a pin's state is read back through GET /api/docs/pins, which the sweep reaches. It relays Docs'
	// answer ({"pinned": bool}) and adds nothing the BFF holds.
	//
	// THE TWENTY-SIXTH, /api/features/stored-answers/delete (B21.4), IS POST ONLY: what is left is read
	// back through GET /api/features/stored-answers, which the sweep reaches. It relays Lens's counts of
	// what it deleted (or its refusal) and adds nothing the BFF holds.
	//
	// THE TWENTY-SEVENTH TO THIRTY-SECOND ARE THE AGENT BANK'S SIX WRITES (B19.4): /api/agents/{id}/fund,
	// /withdraw, /keys and /pay, and /api/agents/approvals/{id}/approve and /deny, all POST only. What
	// they change is read back through GET /api/agents, /api/agents/{id}/statement and

	// adds nothing the BFF holds.
	//
	// THE THIRTY-THIRD TO THIRTY-FIFTH ARE B19.10'S FACE ID AND PUSH WRITES: /api/agents/passkeys/challenge
	// and /api/agents/approvals/{id}/challenge (POST only — a fresh single-use challenge, useless read
	// twice) and /api/agents/push/subscriptions (POST and DELETE). What they change is read back through
	// GET /api/agents/passkeys and /api/agents/approvals, which the sweep reaches; a subscription is
	// never read back at all. Each relays Lens's answer (or its refusal) and adds nothing the BFF holds.
	//
	// THE THIRTY-SIXTH IS B20.3'S /api/marketplace/listings/{id}/use, POST only: a use runs a listing and
	// answers its output once. What it bills is read back through GET /api/marketplace/earnings on the

	// the BFF holds.

	//
	// THE THIRTY-NINTH TO FORTY-SECOND ARE B19.20'S PAUSES: /api/agents/pause-all and /resume-all, and
	// /api/agents/{id}/pause and /resume, all POST only. What they change is read back through GET

	// Lens's answer (or its refusal) and adds nothing the BFF holds.
	//
	// THE FORTY-FIFTH IS B20.11'S /api/marketplace/listings/{id}/reports, POST only: a report goes to

	//
	// THE SEVENTY-NINTH IS B28.23'S GIVE-BACK, write only: POST /api/wallets/transfers/{tid}/refund. What it
	// changes is read back through GET /api/agents/{id}/transfers (the refund, and the original's refunded_by)
	// and GET /api/agents, which the sweep reaches. It relays Lens's answer (or its refusal) and holds nothing.
	//
	// THE EIGHTIETH IS B28.30'S RULE SIMULATOR, POST only: /api/agents/{id}/rules/simulate. It changes nothing —
	// Lens judges the request inside a transaction it always rolls back — and answers only Lens's verdict, reason
	// and the agent's balance, which GET /api/agents and GET /api/agents/{id}/rules already show the sweep.
	//
	// THE EIGHTY-FIRST IS B28.349'S CHAT TOOL CALL, POST only: /api/chat/tools/call. It runs one read-only Lens MCP
	// tool (chat_tools.go's chatTools: what the agents spent) and changes nothing; what it answers is the agents'
	// statement lines, which GET /api/agents/{id}/statement already shows the sweep.
	//
	// THE EIGHTY-SECOND IS B28.31'S RULES ROLLBACK, POST only: /api/agents/{id}/rules/rollback. It writes an earlier

	//
	// THE EIGHTY-THIRD IS B32.14'S BYOK ADD-ON, POST and DELETE only: /api/billing/subscription/byok. It adds or

	// shows the sweep.
	//

	//
	// THE EIGHTY-FIFTH IS B28.359'S TASK FROM CHAT, POST only: /api/agents/{id}/tasks. It runs one task on the agent's
	// wallet and answers the model's answer; what the task cost is read back through GET /api/agents/{id}/statement,
	// which the sweep reaches. The key it runs on is revoked before it answers and never leaves the BFF.
	//
	// THE EIGHTY-SIXTH AND EIGHTY-SEVENTH ARE B28.360'S CARD FREEZE, POST only: /api/agents/{id}/card/freeze and
	// /card/unfreeze. Each relays Lens's answer — the card — and holds nothing; whether the card is frozen is read

	//
	// THE EIGHTY-EIGHTH IS B32.53'S JOINING A ROOM, POST only: /api/rooms/{id}/join. It relays Lens's answer — the

	// through GET /api/rooms/{id}/messages, which the sweep reaches.
	//
	// THE NINETY-SECOND TO NINETY-SIXTH ARE B32.55'S ROOM SETTINGS: a member's change (PATCH /api/rooms/{id}/members/{ws}),

	// (POST /api/rooms/{id}/prizes/{pid}/award) and a join through a link (POST /api/room-invites/{token}/join). Each
	// relays Lens's answer and holds nothing; the members and terms are read back through GET /api/rooms/{id}, the
	// invites through GET /api/rooms/{id}/invites and the prizes through GET /api/rooms/{id}/prizes, which the sweep reaches.
	//
	// THE NINETY-SEVENTH AND NINETY-EIGHTH ARE B28.122'S CONNECTORS, POST only: /api/chat/connectors/tools and
	// /api/chat/connectors/call. Each relays what the person's own MCP server answered for the connector the body names,

	//
	// THE HUNDRED-AND-THIRTEENTH IS B28.450'S DOCS TEAM ROSTER, PUT and DELETE only:

	// THE HUNDRED-AND-NINETEENTH TO HUNDRED-AND-TWENTY-SECOND ARE B30.96'S, POST only: /api/money/payees/{id}/challenge answers
	// a one-time challenge and stores nothing readable; …/{id}/confirm relays the payee as it now reads, read back through GET

	// /api/docs/webhooks/{id} and POST /api/docs/spaces/{spaceID}/pages/{pageID}/approval. The first two relay Docs'
	// answer as Track's do; the third relays the approval request Docs made, and holds nothing. B39.25 put GET on
	// /api/docs/webhooks (the list, no secret on it, now in the sweep's reach) and took its place with POST
	// /api/docs/webhooks/{id}/rotate, which relays the new secret, shown once like the create's.
	//
	// THE HUNDRED-AND-TWENTY-EIGHTH IS B41.60'S ASKING THE ROOM'S AI, POST only: /api/rooms/{id}/ask. It relays Lens's
	// answer and holds nothing; the question and the answer are read back as a run message through

	//
	// THE HUNDRED-AND-TWENTY-NINTH TO THIRTY-FIRST ARE B40.35'S, POST only: /api/money/assistant-requests/{id}/dismiss
	// answers nothing; …/{id}/prepare relays the drafted mandate's canonical terms and a one-time challenge, holding
	// nothing new; and …/{id}/sign relays the mandate Lens kept, read back through the MCP's list_mandates. The waiting

// skips was that the Origin family covers write routes. THE ORIGIN FAMILY ASKS A DIFFERENT
// QUESTION — whether a write refuses a foreign Origin — and never reads what a write answers.
//
// ⚠ MEASURED AT a1bf848, not read off the lists: every unsafe method driven at every mounted
// pattern through a.ServeHTTP in the three fixtures below reaches a handler in 37 method×route
// shapes. Exactly ONE of those 37 is searched by assertNoSecretLeak today (POST /api/lxc/checkout,
// from billing_test.go). The other 36 are searched by nothing.
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS LIVE, NOT LATENT — positive-controlled, verdicts read from `--- FAIL:` lines over
// the whole package, never from an exit code (~/talyvor-queue/w11-writeleak-controls-b3d7.py):
//
//	S1  the provisioning secret in POST /api/lxc/checkout's response HEADER (the ONE swept
//	    write) → CAUGHT, by TestCheckoutForwardsToPinnedWorkspaceWithKeyAndReturnsTheURL. The
//	    armed control: without it every verdict below is unreadable.
//	U1  THE SAME SECRET in POST /api/keys' response header — the mint, the one response in this
//	    BFF that legitimately carries a credential → NOT CAUGHT. 350 tests ran; none failed.
//	U2  the same secret in POST /api/pooling's BODY → NOT CAUGHT (so it is not header-blindness).
//	U3  a GATEWAY secret on DELETE /api/keys/{id} → NOT CAUGHT (not one needle, not one verb).
//	U4  the same secret in POST /api/distill's BODY → NOT CAUGHT, and GET on that same path IS
//	    swept by the test above. The blindness is the VERB, not the route.

// before any proxy copy happens. A sweep that only ever saw 503 envelopes would be searching the
