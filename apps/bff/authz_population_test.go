// authz_population_test.go — EVERY MOUNTED ROUTE REFUSES AN ANONYMOUS READ, OR IS CLASSIFIED
// PUBLIC WITH A REASON. The third leg of the completeness family, and the one that was missing.
//
// ── THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR, MEASURED RATHER THAN REASONED ───────────
//
// Two of this package's three sweeps already take their population from the ROUTER:
//
//	sameorigin_test.go#TestEveryMutatingRoute_IsGuardedOrExplicitlyExempt   every mounted pattern,
//	                                                                       every unsafe method
//	leaksweep_population_test.go#TestLeakSweep_CoversEveryMountedGETRoute   every mounted pattern,
//	                                                                       GET, searched for secrets
//
// The claim "these routes sit behind requireSession" had no such instrument. It rested on
// HAND-WRITTEN per-route lists — products_test.go#TestProductRoutesRequireSession names TWO
// endpoints, TestDocsIdRoutesRequireSession four, track_test.go#TestTrackIdRoutesRequireSession
// four — which is exactly the shape mountedPatterns() was introduced to replace, one leg later.
//
// MEASURED at 300fd5b on the real tree, not read
// (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-authzpopulation-controls-9d2b.py`; every mutation anchor-count-asserted
// before the edit, restored in a `finally` and verified back by sha256, `git status` asserted,
// verdicts read from `--- FAIL:` lines over the whole package):
//
//	M1  a NEW route mounted with no require* wrapper, ANY method, answering tenant-shaped JSON
//	    → CAUGHT, by the Origin sweep. Not because it is unauthenticated — because it ACCEPTS a
//	    write. The catch is a side effect of a different question.
//	M1b THE HOLE: the same route made GET-ONLY (405 on anything else) → rc=0, NOTHING FAILED.
//	    An anonymous GET got 200 and a body. The write half is covered, the read half is not.
//	M0  and the trap that made the first control worthless, recorded rather than quietly fixed:
//	    mounting the probe as `a.wsProxyFixed(...)` also passed — because wsProxyFixed requires
//	    the session ITSELF. A control that mutates through a helper carrying the property under
//	    test proves nothing. The mutation has to be a RAW handler, which is what the realistic
//	    rot looks like: a route added straight onto the mux with the wrapper forgotten.
//
// ⚠ IT PASSED ON ITS FIRST RUN, WHICH IS ALSO WHAT A GUARD THAT CANNOT FAIL LOOKS LIKE. So every
// branch of it has its own control, and every verdict is read from the FAILING TEST NAME rather
// than from the package's exit code (same script, 8/8):
//
//	P1  M1b restored → this test REDS naming /api/probe9d2b, and it is the ONLY newly-failing
//	    test in the package, so the catch is this file's and not a neighbour's.
//	P2  /api/members regressed to a hand-rolled proxy with no session check → REDS naming the
//	    route AND naming the TRACK upstream it reached, so the credentialed-call assertion at the
//	    bottom is armed rather than decorative. (Seven other tests red too — a real route losing
//	    its tenancy breaks a lot. That is why P1 exists: the NEW-route case is the one only this
//	    file sees.)
//	P3  the route SCAN blinded — `a.mux.` split from `HandleFunc(` across a line, so the regex
//	    matches none of the 40 mount sites while the router still mounts every one → the
//	    POPULATION FLOOR reds. The Origin sweep's and both leak sweeps' floors red on the same
//	    mutation, which is what a shared premise going dark should look like.
//	P4  /api/context listed in publicReadRoutes while it still refuses → the STALE branch reds.
//	P5  ordinary growth — a new route WITH requireSession → GREEN. It is a rule, not a snapshot.
//	P6  BLINDING — this file deleted, M1b's defect present → rc=0, NOT CAUGHT. Nothing else in
//	    this package was watching.
//	P7  a route mounted in version.go → TestRouteMountsLiveInLensGoAlone reds naming the file.
//
// ── WHAT THIS ASKS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// It drives GET with NO session cookie at every pattern the router mounts and requires 401 or
// 403 — or an entry in publicReadRoutes with the reason it is public. A 405 is neither: the
// route has no read surface to leak, so it is counted and skipped rather than excused.
//
// The second direction keeps the table honest: a pattern listed public that now REFUSES fails
// as stale, so a reason cannot outlive the thing it described. That is `awaiting.ts`'s rule and
// check-audit-reach.mjs's, in Go.
//
// ⚠ LIMITS, STATED HERE RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE DISCOVERED:
//   - It asks whether a route ANSWERS an anonymous reader, not whether an authenticated reader
//     is scoped to their own tenant. That is tenant_boundary_test.go's question and this is not
//     a substitute for it.
//   - It drives GET only. HEAD/OPTIONS are Go's mux defaults on the same handler.
//     ⚠ THIS LINE USED TO HAND THE UNSAFE METHODS TO THE ORIGIN SWEEP, AND THAT WAS A FALSE
//     STATEMENT ABOUT WHAT THAT SWEEP ASKS. The Origin sweep asks whether a write route checks
//     the ORIGIN HEADER; it never asks whether one checks the SESSION. Nothing did, and
//     /api/pooling was measurably open to a gate deletion no test in the package could see —
//     see TestEveryMountedRoute_RefusesAnonymousWrite at the bottom of this file, which now
//     owns that half.
//   - ⚠ AND ITS 405 BRANCH IS AN ESCAPE HATCH, NOT MERELY A GAP: removing a write-only route's
//     auth wrapper turns that route's anonymous GET from a 401 into the 405 counted below as
//     "no read surface", so the defect enters through the branch that excuses it.
//   - The refusal is asserted as a STATUS. A route that 401s and streams a body anyway would
//     pass here — assertNoSecretLeak is the sweep that reads bodies.

// publicReadRoutes — patterns that answer an anonymous GET on purpose, each with the reason.
//
// A reason is a claim about the product, checkable by reading the file named in it. The day it
// stops being true, the STALE direction below is what makes someone delete the line.

// ── THE HOLE IT CLOSES, MEASURED ONE MUTATION AT A TIME ──────────────────────
//
// The GET sweep's own stated limit is "it drives GET only", handing the unsafe methods to the
// Origin sweep. But the Origin sweep asks about the ORIGIN header, not about the session — so
// the question "does this write route refuse a stranger" was asked by nobody except hand-written
// per-route tests, and those are the shape mountedPatterns() exists to replace.
//
// ⚠ WORSE THAN A GAP: THE GET SWEEP'S 405 BRANCH EXCUSES EXACTLY THIS DEFECT. It counts a route
// that answers 405 to an anonymous GET as "no read surface" and moves on — and removing a
// write-only route's auth wrapper is PRECISELY what turns that route's anonymous GET from a 401
// into that 405. The defect walks into the excused bucket on its way in.
//
// MEASURED at fc3c0e7 by removing each write-only route's gate ALONE and reading the failing
// test NAMES out of the whole package:
//
//	/api/lxc/checkout   → caught by TestCheckoutRequiresSession
//	/api/lens/convert   → caught by TestConvert_RequiresASession
//	/api/keys/{id}      → caught by TestRevokeRequiresSession
//	/api/pooling        → NOTHING FAILED. An anonymous POST reached the handler's own body
//	                     validation (400 `cache_poolable (boolean) required`) — the handler RAN
//	                     for a stranger, and the workspace's cache-pooling choice is an economics
//	                     setting. Three companions and a hole is what a hand-maintained list is.
//	/api/docs/ai/ask    → NOTHING FAILED either, but that route still fails closed: three layers
//	                     answer a byte-identical 401. See TestDocsAsk_RequiresASession.
//
// ⚠ NO Origin HEADER, AND THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF AN OVERSIGHT — IT IS THE TRAP THIS SWEEP CAME
