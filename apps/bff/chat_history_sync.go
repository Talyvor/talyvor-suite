// chat_history_sync.go — B28.365: Chat's history, synced across a person's devices when they turn it on.
//
// THE BROWSER ENCRYPTS; LENS KEEPS WHAT IT CANNOT READ. apps/web's historySync.ts seals the whole history with
// AES-GCM under a key derived in the browser from a passphrase the person chooses, and only the sealed copy leaves
// it. Without the passphrase the copy is noise to the BFF and to Lens alike, so a private chat's words still never
// reach a server in a form anyone there can read. Sync off, the browser makes none of these calls.
//
//	GET    /api/chat/history-sync   the sealed copy: {"version","salt","iv","ciphertext","updated_at"}; version 0
//	                                and empty strings while nothing is stored
//	PUT    /api/chat/history-sync   {"base_version","salt","iv","ciphertext"} stores a new copy over base_version:
//	                                200 {"version","updated_at"}, or 409 when another device stored one first
//	DELETE /api/chat/history-sync   removes the stored copy
//
// THE LENS SIDE (B28.107) is /v1/workspaces/{ws}/chat-history with the session's workspace token, the same three
// methods and bodies: it stores the three strings as they arrive, versions them (the stored version + 1 on every PUT
// whose base_version is the stored one, 409 otherwise), and answers GET with version 0 while it holds none. A 404
// from Lens therefore means the route is not there, and the screen says sync is not available rather than that
// nothing is stored. The workspace is the session's, in the path, never one the browser names.

// historySyncMaxBytes bounds a sealed copy in both directions. A history lives in localStorage, which a browser holds
// to about 5 MB, and base64 adds a third.
