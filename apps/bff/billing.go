// The BFF's SECOND write path: starting a Stripe Checkout Session so a customer
// can actually buy LXC. The Lens half of this has been complete and correct for
// a while — checkout, a signature-verified webhook, exactly-once crediting on
// stripe_event_id with server-recomputed amounts. What was missing was the front
// door: no BFF route, no UI, no return pages. Lens's default redirect already
// points at app.talyvor.com/billing/success — the design assumed the suite owned
// those routes and nobody had built them. This file is the first of the three.
//
// IT FOLLOWS keys.go, DELIBERATELY. Same CSRF posture (Lax cookie + strict
// same-Origin, fail-closed when Origin is absent — see keys.go's argument, which
// applies here unchanged), same sanitise-by-reconstruction, same server-side-only
// key attachment, same no-store on the one response that must not be retained.
// A second write path is exactly the wrong place to invent a second shape.
//
// ── THE ALLOW-LIST, AND WHY IT IS MIRRORED HERE ─────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠ B5.1 CHANGED THE PREMISE BELOW: Lens now accepts any whole-cent amount in bounds, the three
// sizes are presets, and what is enforced here is minTopUpCents/maxTopUpCents. The mirroring
// argument is unchanged — Lens serves the bounds on no endpoint either.
//
// Lens accepts only $10 / $50 / $100 (internal/billing/billing.go
// `allowedTopUps`). It also has `AllowedTopUpCents()` — which is called by
// NOTHING: the list is exposed on no HTTP endpoint, so the BFF genuinely cannot
// read it at runtime. Copying it here is therefore forced, and the copy is the
// weak point, so it is handled rather than hidden:
//
//   · one declaration (allowedTopUpCents), served to the UI by
//     /api/lxc/topup-options — the SCREEN never hardcodes an amount, so it can
//     never offer a button this BFF would refuse;
//   · TestAllowedTopUpsRestatedDeliberately makes a change to THIS list a
//     two-place edit rather than a slip. ⚠ IT IS NOT A PIN AGAINST LENS, AND
//     THIS LINE USED TO CLAIM IT WAS. The test declares the same three literals
//     in the same package and compares copy to copy; it reads nothing of
//     talyvor-lens and no test here can, because CI checks out this repository
//     alone. A guard that reads a sibling repo only when it happens to be
//     present is inert in CI — which is precisely where it would have to fire.
//     The cross-repo half is a DEPLOY-TIME command instead:
//     deploy/decision-expiry.sh prints it in its UNCHECKABLE-HERE half with the
//     exact grep to run in a talyvor-lens checkout, and
//     apps/web/src/topUpMirrorRegister.test.ts keeps the amounts in that command
//     equal to the amounts declared below;
//   · and if the two repos ever DO drift, Lens answers 400 and this file
//     reports that as a version mismatch naming both lists — not as the
//     customer having typed something wrong. ⚠ THAT COVERS REMOVAL ONLY, and
//     removal is the direction the list is documented never to move in. The
//     expected drift is an APPEND: Lens starts selling a fourth size,
//     amountAllowed refuses it before any dial, /api/lxc/topup-options never
//     offers it, the screen never draws the button, and NOTHING goes red in
//     either repo — the only symptom is revenue that does not arrive. That
//     direction is the register entry's whole subject.
//
// The one-line fix that would remove the copy entirely lives in the other repo:
// expose AllowedTopUpCents() on a public Lens route and read it here.
//
// ── WHY A 404 FROM LENS MEANS "BILLING IS OFF" ──────────────────────────────
//
// Lens registers the checkout route only under LENS_BILLING_ENABLED (its
// billReg gate); with billing off the route is never registered and the POST
// meets a chi-native 404. That reading is safe here for the same reason
// proxyGated's is, and a bit more strongly:
//
//   · the upstream path is PINNED at registration from config — no client input
//     shapes it, so there is no "real not-found" for a bad id to be confused with;
//   · Lens's checkout handler itself never answers 404 (400 for a bad body or a
//     disallowed amount, 500 otherwise, 200 on success — verified in source);
//   · its middlewares answer 401 (no credential) and 403 (foreign workspace),
//     not 404.
//
// So on THIS route, 404 ⟺ billing disabled. It is reported as 503 +
// billing_enabled:false — the same shape forwardProduct already uses for "this
// deployment does not have that wired" — and NOT as 200, because a POST that
// answered 200 without starting a purchase would be a lie. Every other non-200
// stays a fault (502): a 5xx or an unreachable Lens must never be laundered
// into "the feature is off".

// Lens exposes this list on no endpoint (AllowedTopUpCents has zero callers), so
// this copy is unavoidable. What keeps it honest is a DEPLOY-TIME check and not
// a test: deploy/decision-expiry.sh's uncheckable half carries the grep to run
// in a talyvor-lens checkout, and apps/web/src/topUpMirrorRegister.test.ts keeps

// TO THIS FILE'S OWN REASONING, NOT AN EXCEPTION TO IT. The amounts are mirrored above because Lens
// exposes the LIST on no endpoint; that paragraph is right. It does NOT extend to the PEG. Lens
// serves GET /v1/economy/conversion-rate → {"usd_per_lxc": economy.LXCUSDValue} on its
// UNAUTHENTICATED, rate-limited public group, so a second copy of a money constant is avoidable
// here — and an avoidable copy of a price is the exact defect the mirror above needs a whole
// paragraph to justify.
//
// HOW IT CANNOT CHARGE OR CHANGE ANYTHING: it is a GET, on a route Lens registers on its PUBLIC
// read-only group, and the only thing read out of the response is one float. There is no body to
// send and no write path to reach.
//
// FAIL-QUIET, AND THE DIRECTION IS THE POINT. Every failure — unreachable, non-200, malformed, or a
// non-positive value — returns ok=false and the field is omitted. A WRONG conversion on a money
// screen is worse than no conversion: the customer would be told what they are buying, incorrectly,
// before they commit. Note this is the OPPOSITE posture to probeBillingEnabled directly above,
// which is deliberately optimistic — a false "billing off" hides a working paid feature, while a
// false peg misstates a price. The two failures are not symmetric, so the two defaults are not either.
//
// ⚠ ECONOMY-OFF IS A 404 HERE, exactly as billing-off is for the probe above: econReg.get simply
