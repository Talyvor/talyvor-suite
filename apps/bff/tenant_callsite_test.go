package main

// tenant_callsite_test.go — guards the CALL SITES, not just the property.
//
// The behavioural tests in tenant_boundary_test.go prove that two sessions reach two workspaces.
// But they build their own request against the routes that exist TODAY. If a later refactor
// reintroduces a startup-scoped workspace — a config field, a path assembled at registration, a
// handler closing over a captured id — those tests keep passing for every route they happen to
// name, and say nothing about a new one.
//
// That is exactly the failure mode found on the Lens side: a behavioural test that documented the
// hazard could not notice the production mount moving, because it never read the production file.
// So this reads the source.
//
// THREE THINGS ARE ASSERTED, all of them about shape rather than behaviour — deliberately,
// because the hazard IS a property of the call site:
//
//  1. The config carries no Lens workspace id or workspace key. If neither exists, no handler can
//     close over one.
//  2. The Lens workspace path prefix is assembled in exactly ONE place (lensWorkspacePath), which
//     takes the workspace from a tenant. Everywhere else must go through it.
//  3. LENS_API_KEY is never read. The BFF must hold the narrow provisioning secret, never the
//     admin key that authorises every workspace.

// ⚠ THE MISTAKE IT CATCHES. Docs' prefixes are NOT uniform. Space create is POST /v1/spaces with
// the workspace in the BODY, and every by-id route (space detail, page list/create/detail/update)
// is registered at the TOP LEVEL. When Docs went per-identity, docsWorkspacePath was applied to
// all six call sites. Five of them then addressed paths Docs does not register, so opening a space
// returned Go's default `404 page not found` — which the web app reported as "Docs is not
// configured on this deployment", blaming the operator for our routing.
//
// ⚠ THIS TEST USED TO ASSERT `total == 1` AND TO SAY WHY: "Docs registers ONLY
// GET /v1/workspaces/{wsID}/spaces under a workspace." THAT SENTENCE WAS FALSE WHEN IT WAS
// WRITTEN. Measured at talyvor-docs `d7d936f` by grepping the chi mounts, Docs registers
// TWENTY-FOUR patterns under /workspaces/{wsID}/ — among them all five AI routes
// (ai/ask, ai/write, ai/transform, ai/translate, ai/suggest-title), search, pages/search,
// pages/stale, freshness, changelog/feed, analytics/pages, approvals/pending, template-library
// (4), custom-domains (4) and the two track/* reads. The count was a true statement about THIS
// repository's one call site dressed as a false statement about the UPSTREAM's route table, and
// the difference matters: every Tier-2/Tier-3 row in areas/docs/BFF-GAPS.md that this BFF has
// still to proxy is workspace-scoped upstream, so the old rule forbade all of them and gave a
// reason that was not true.
//
// ⚠ WHAT REPLACES THE COUNT, AND WHY IT IS NOT A PER-FUNCTION ALLOWLIST. The old comment's
// objection to an allowlist was right — the failure was ONE builder used in five wrong places, and
// a list of allowed FUNCTIONS would have passed while every one of them built a broken path. So
// the register below is keyed on the (function, SUFFIX) pair, which is the thing that was wrong,
// and above it sits a rule no register entry can waive: a suffix that reaches into the
// top-level /spaces/… or /pages/… families is refused outright. That is the incident's exact
// shape, and it stays unrepresentable however the register grows.
//
