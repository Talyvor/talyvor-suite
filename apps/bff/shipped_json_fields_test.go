// EVERY FIELD THIS SERVICE SHIPS AS JSON MUST BE FILLED BY SOMETHING.
//
// Go zero-fills a field omitted from a keyed composite literal SILENTLY. Add
// `Foo string `+"`json:\"foo\"`"+` to a response type, forget the construction site, and the
// build succeeds, the tests pass, and every client receives `"foo": ""` — a
// value that looks measured and is structural.
//
// THIS ESTATE HAS SHIPPED THAT CLASS THREE TIMES, ALWAYS ONE LAYER DOWN:
//
//	talyvor-lens  token_events.cached      — a structural 0 reported as a measured
//	                                         cache hit rate, and separately
//	                                         estimated_savings_usd = $0.00 for a year.
//	talyvor-track members.avatar_url       — TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '', no writer, served
//	                                         on three surfaces, with a comment that said
//	                                         "Track already stores the field" (W3.66,
//	                                         internal/schemaguard).
//
// The BFF is where that kind of value reaches a person. This file asks the same
// question about the layer above the database: of the fields this service puts
// on the wire, is there any that nothing can ever fill?
//
// ⚠ THE ANSWER TODAY IS NONE, AND THAT IS WHY THIS IS A GUARD AND NOT A FIX.
// Every json-tagged field on every struct this service builds is set, at every
// construction site or by an assignment declared below. This file makes that a
// maintained fact instead of a fact about one afternoon.
//
// ⚠ IT ADDS NO PERMISSION, REMOVES NONE, AND CHANGES NO BEHAVIOUR.

// for the whole excuse, not a coverage check on the arms, and it cannot tell one
