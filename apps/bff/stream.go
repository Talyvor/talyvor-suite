// stream.go — W4.6.1 STEP 3: streaming inference through the BFF to a browser.
//
// ⚠ THREE THINGS STOOD IN THE WAY, AND ONLY TWO OF THEM WERE ON THE LIST.
//
//  1. NO CREDENTIAL. Lens wraps every /v1/proxy/* route in RequireScope("proxy"); the BFF's
//     provisioned session token carries {analytics, keys} and is refused 403. Closed by
//     talyvor-lens #460 — session-scoped keys — so the BFF mints a NARROW, short-lived {proxy}
//     credential per session rather than (a) widening provisionScopes, which would give every
//     signed-in browser session a workspace-wide inference capability, or (b) minting a workspace
//     API key, which is worse still: no TTL, survives sign-out, and revocable only by hand.
//
//  2. NO FLUSH. The shared `forward` io.Copy's into the ResponseWriter. net/http buffers ~2KB
//     before anything reaches the wire, so a handful of SSE bytes SITS THERE until the buffer
//     fills or the handler returns. The browser sees one lump at the end, which is exactly not
//     streaming — and the finished bytes are IDENTICAL either way, which is why the test for this
//     asserts TIMING and not content.
//
//  3. ⚠ A TEN-SECOND WHOLE-EXCHANGE TIMEOUT ON THE SHARED CLIENT, WHICH NOBODY HAD NAMED.
//     `a.client` is `&http.Client{Timeout: 10 * time.Second}`, and http.Client.Timeout covers
//     READING THE BODY — not just the handshake. A flushing relay on that client streams
//     beautifully and is then guillotined at ten seconds, truncating every completion longer than
//     that, which is most of them. Fixing the flush alone would have shipped that.
//
//     The bound does not disappear; it moves to where it belongs. ResponseHeaderTimeout bounds the
//     phase that can actually hang without progress (waiting for the first byte), and the client's
//     own request context bounds the whole thing — so a browser that goes away ends the stream,
//     rather than a stopwatch that cannot tell a working stream from a stuck one.
