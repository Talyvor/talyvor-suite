// The LENS → LXC conversion: the exit that earned LENS did not have.
//
// ── WHAT WAS MISSING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Lens has had POST /v1/workspaces/{wsID}/lxc/convert and economy.ConvertLENStoLXC for a while.
// The BFF had no conversion code and the UI had none, so a workspace could EARN LENS from a pooled
// royalty and had no way to spend it: a balance with no exit. That matters more the moment the
// royalty actually pays, which is what the pool-royalty work was building toward.
//
// ── THREE FACTS THE SCREEN MUST HAVE BEFORE THE CLICK, ALL READ FROM SOURCE ─
//
//  1. THE RATE. economy.RateEngine.CurrentRate reads conversion_rate_history, falling back to
//     economy.Phase1FloorRate (1.0). It is LENS-per-LXC, and it CHANGES — so it is quoted from the
//     deployment rather than written into the bundle, the same reason the top-up amounts are.
//  2. THE MINIMUM. economy.MinConversionLXC = 100_000 µLXC (0.1 LXC). Below it the upstream
//     returns ErrConversionTooSmall, and a screen that lets you type 1 µLXC only to be refused has
//     wasted the round trip.
//  3. ⚠ IT IS ONE-WAY. There is NO LXC→LENS conversion anywhere in Lens — the reverse function
//     does not exist, not merely a flag that is off. LENS spent here cannot come back, so the
//     screen says so BEFORE the button, not in a toast afterwards.
//
// ── THE ROUNDING, AND WHY IT CANNOT CREATE VALUE ────────────────────────────
//
// The caller names the LXC it wants; Lens charges lensCost = MulCeil(lxcAmount, rate) and mints
// exactly lxcAmount. The LENS debit rounds UP (a charge to the holder, the sub-unit retained by
// the protocol) and the LXC credit is exact. So a conversion is never value-creating in either
// direction, and the BFF deliberately recomputes nothing: quoting a cost here that disagreed with
// what Lens charges would be a second source of truth for one number.

// convertQuote is what the screen needs to render the form honestly. Assembled here rather than
// passed through, because it is three facts from two upstream shapes plus one constant.
type convertQuote struct {
	LENSPerLXC     float64 `json:"lens_per_lxc"`
	USDPerLXC      float64 `json:"usd_per_lxc"`
	MinLXCMicros   int64   `json:"min_lxc_ulxc"`
	Reversible     bool    `json:"reversible"`
	ReversibleNote string  `json:"reversible_note"`
}

// minConversionULXC mirrors economy.MinConversionLXC. Duplicated deliberately and named so:
// the BFF cannot import Lens's internal package, and a screen that discovers the minimum by being
// refused is a worse experience than one that knows it.
//
// ⚠ WHAT PINS IT, STATED AFTER MEASURING RATHER THAN CLAIMED. This comment used to name a test as
// pinning the value "against the number Lens actually enforces". No such test existed, and NOTHING
// in this repo compares this constant to Lens — the BFF cannot import that package and CI does not
// check talyvor-lens out, so a cross-repo pin is not available here to write honestly.
//
// What DOES hold the value is incidental and worth knowing precisely, because it decides what a
// reader may rely on. The conversion tests post literal amounts either side of this boundary, so
// the constant cannot move without reding them — MEASURED by moving it: to 1 reds
// TestConvert_BelowMinimumRefusedBeforeDialing, and by a SINGLE micro-unit (100_001) reds
// TestConvert_AddressesTheSessionWorkspaceOnly and TestConvert_InsufficientLENSReachesTheScreen.
// So an ACCIDENTAL edit here is caught. DRIFT IN LENS IS NOT: if economy.MinConversionLXC changes,
// every test here stays green and this deployment quotes a minimum the upstream no longer
// enforces — the screen would then either refuse a conversion Lens would take, or promise one it
// would refuse after the round trip this constant exists to save.
//
// The one change that would close it lives in the other repo, exactly as with the top-up
// allow-list: serve the minimum on a public Lens route and read it here instead of copying it.
// Verified read-only against talyvor-lens `a04310a`: internal/economy/dualtoken.go declares
// MinConversionLXC = 100_000, so the copy is correct as of that commit — and that sentence is a
// dated observation, not a guarantee, which is the whole point of writing it this way.

	// ConvertLens.tsx prints "Rate: 0 LENS per LXC", `lensCostForLXC` returns ceil(micros × 0)
	// = 0, and `tooExpensive = cost > balance` is false for EVERY amount, so the panel promises
	// a free conversion and enables the button against an empty balance, one irreversible click
	// before Lens charges the real rate.
	//
	// Refusing costs nothing true, because zero is never a genuine reading. Measured read-only at
	// talyvor-lens `a04310a`: `RateEngine.CurrentRate` answers `Phase1FloorRate` (1.0) with no
