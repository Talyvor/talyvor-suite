/**
 * stampBuild writes the commit this bundle was built from into the build output, so the deployed
 * web artifact can be identified WITHOUT asking the BFF. The two ship as separate operations
 * against the same host (deploy/README.md step 3b), so the BFF's version is not evidence about
 * the bundle's.
 *
 * It emits the same value twice, on purpose, because the two get read in different situations:
 *
 *   · dist/version.json — the operator surface. `curl $APP/version.json | jq` during a deploy,
 *     and the file the BFF reads off disk to report which bundle it is serving.
 *
 *     ⚠ ON A BUNDLE THAT PREDATES THIS, THAT PATH RETURNS 404. It used to return index.html with
 *     STATUS 200, because the BFF's spaHandler fell back to index.html for any path that is not a
 *     real file — so `curl -f`, and anything else that tests the status code, passed against a
 *     bundle carrying no version at all. `/version.json` and `/assets/…` are now excluded from
 *     that fallback (apps/bff/lens.go, isBuildOwnedPath). A check should still require the
 *     response to PARSE AS JSON: that proves it is a version payload rather than merely present,
 *     and it stays true through a proxy or static host with a fallback of its own.
 *
 *     ⚠ THE BFF's EXCLUSION IS A PREFIX ON `assets/` — VITE'S DEFAULT assetsDir, WHICH THIS FILE
 *     DOES NOT OVERRIDE. Setting `build.assetsDir` here would move the emitted files out from
 *     under it and silently restore the 200-with-HTML answer for every missing asset.
 *     deploy/decision-expiry.sh holds that premise.
 *
 *   · a <meta name="talyvor-build"> in index.html — immune to that ambiguity, because index.html
 *     IS the fallback: the tag is either there or it is not. Also readable from the DOM with no
 *     network call at all, if a UI surface ever wants to show it.
 *
 * Both come from one `payload` computed once here, so they cannot disagree within a build.
 *
 * ⚠ NO GIT FALLBACK, DELIBERATELY. It is tempting to shell out to `git rev-parse` when
 * SUITE_COMMIT is unset so that local builds are "stamped too". That would be a different lie: it
 * names a commit while the working tree may hold uncommitted changes, and it would make an
 * unstamped build indistinguishable from a real one. Unset stays unstamped and says so.
