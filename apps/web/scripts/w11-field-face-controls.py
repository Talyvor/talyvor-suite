"""POSITIVE CONTROLS FOR THE NUMERIC-FIELD AUDIT (#w11 fieldFaceAudit).

Every guard this merge adds PASSED ON ITS FIRST RUN. That is the state this repo has shipped
three unfalsifiable guards from, so none of them is believed until it has been observed failing.

THE FORM, which is this repo's and is not negotiable:
  · Every edit's anchor count is ASSERTED BEFORE the write. A control that silently matched
    nothing scores NOT CAUGHT and reads exactly like a blind guard.
  · Every file is restored from SAVED BYTES, never `git checkout` — the tree carries an
    uncommitted fix and checkout would revert the FIX instead of the MUTATION.
  · Every control PREDICTS ITS CATCHER by name before the run. A CAUGHT verdict that names a
    different test than predicted is a refuted prediction and is printed as one.
  · Every control has a MUST-STAY-GREEN companion, so a compile error cannot score as a catch.
  · sha256 of every touched file is compared before and after.

Usage:  python3 scripts/w11-field-face-controls.py         (run all)
        python3 scripts/w11-field-face-controls.py C3      (run one)
