POSITIVE CONTROLS FOR src/proseClasses.test.ts — and for the config change it guards.

Every control names, BEFORE it runs, (a) the test it predicts will catch the mutation and
(b) a MUST-STAY-GREEN companion that is expected to be blind to it. A control that reds the
whole suite justifies nothing: it cannot tell you which guard spoke. A control that reds
NOTHING is only interesting if the mutation was behaviourally real, so each one asserts its
anchor exists exactly once before any byte is written, and asserts the file changed on disk
after.

The tree is restored by sha256, not by an exit code.
