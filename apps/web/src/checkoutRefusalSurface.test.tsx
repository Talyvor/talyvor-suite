// checkoutRefusalSurface.test.tsx — THE PAYMENT BUTTON THAT SAID NOTHING WHEN THE REQUEST
// NEVER GOT AN ANSWER.
//
// /billing is the only place a customer can buy LXC, and TopUp.tsx opens with a promise:
// "Fail silently … A top-up page about to ask for money that just greys out is worse than no
// page at all." Every failure it names — billing off, expired session, rejected origin,
// allow-list drift, unreachable Lens — arrives as its own sentence.
//
// ⚠ THE SENTENCE WAS GATED ON THE ERROR'S CLASS, NOT ON THERE BEING AN ERROR. TopUp.tsx read
//
//     const failure = start.error instanceof CheckoutError ? start.error : null
//     …
//     {failure ? <p>{failureText(failure.kind, failure.detail)}</p> : null}
//
// so an error that is not a `CheckoutError` set `failure` to null and rendered NOTHING. Every
// OTHER error surface in this product gates on `isError` and uses `instanceof` only INSIDE the
// block to choose better words — Keys.tsx:131/133, ConvertLens.tsx:379/386,
// IssueList.tsx:429/390 all have that shape, each with a fallback. TopUp was the only surface
// in the app where the class check WAS the gate (measured: the one `instanceof` outside a
// `.isError ?` in any .tsx).
//
// WHAT REACHES IT. `topupApi.checkout` raises a CheckoutError for every answer it gets — every
// status, and even a 200 with no url (topupApi.ts:260). What it cannot convert is not getting
// an answer at all: `fetch` REJECTS (offline, DNS failure, connection reset, TLS failure) with
// a TypeError, which is not a CheckoutError.
//
// MEASURED before this file existed, real `<App/>` at /billing, real shipped queryClient,
// clicking the $10 button and counting the characters the click adds to the page:
//
//     checkout answered with        POST sent   characters added   session bar
//     ---------------------------   ---------   ----------------   -----------
//     503 billing disabled          yes                      150   no
//     401 signed out                yes                       85   yes
//     403 origin refused            yes                      115   no
//     400 amount refused            yes                        7   no   (the BFF's own words)
//     502 upstream                  yes                        7   no   (the BFF's own words)
//     200 with no session url       yes                       67   no
//     fetch REJECTS (offline)       yes                        0   no
//
// ⚠ ZERO CHARACTERS, AND THE POST WAS SENT. The button returns from "Starting…" to "$10" and
// the page is byte-identical to before the click. The customer is told nothing at all — the
// exact outcome the file's header says must not exist. (400 and 502 add only 7 because the
// screen echoes the BFF's own sentence verbatim; the fixture's was "up: 400".)
//
// ⚠ WHY SIX GREEN FAILURE TESTS COULD NOT SEE IT. TopUp.test.tsx drives every honest failure
// state, and its fixture answers each one by RETURNING a Response. A returned Response — any
// status, including a 200 with no url — always becomes a CheckoutError, so the gate is
// satisfied in all six. No test in the repo made `fetch` itself reject, so the one failure mode
// the gate excludes was the one no fixture could produce.
//
// ⚠ AND NO BAR COVERS FOR IT. Measured false above: a fetch rejection carries no status, so
// `isSessionExpired` (ApiError + 401) is false, and the mutation error never reaches the query
// cache that SessionExpiredBar derives from. The App's only global handler is
// `QueryCache.onError` (App.tsx:100) — queries, not mutations.
//
// THE FIX SAYS NOTHING NEW. The fallback is the sentence topupApi.ts already raises for an
// answer it cannot use (`'upstream'`, topupApi.ts:264): "Couldn't start the payment — nothing
// was charged. Please try again." It is honest for a rejection by construction — this call only
// asks Lens to create a Stripe Checkout Session, and the payment happens at Stripe AFTER the
// redirect (TopUp.tsx:29, apps/bff/billing.go:300), so a call that never completed cannot
// have charged anyone.
