/**
 * THE COMMANDS THE EXPIRY REGISTER TELLS A DEPLOYER TO RUN MUST BE ABLE TO SAY NO.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `deploy/decision-expiry.sh` splits its premises in two. The ones it can read from this repo
 * it CHECKS, and its footer forbids silencing them. The ones that live in talyvor-track /
 * talyvor-docs / a third-party origin it cannot read, so it prints them as UNCHECKABLE with a
 * command, and its last line says: "run their commands in the named repo before a deploy."
 *
 * That sentence is the whole load-bearing structure of the uncheckable half. It is worth
 * exactly as much as the commands are: a command that exits 0 when the premise is FALSE turns
 * "someone will notice" into "someone confirmed it", which is strictly worse than the prose the
 * register replaced. The register's own header ranks a documented command as the WEAKEST of its
 * three forms; this is the failure mode that makes it weaker still.
 *
 * ── THE TWO HAZARDS, MEASURED RATHER THAN REASONED ABOUT ─────────────────────
 *
 * H1 — `go test <pkg> -run <filter>` EXITS 0 WHEN THE FILTER MATCHES NOTHING. Measured on a
 *      throwaway module holding one passing test:
 *
 *        $ go test ./... -run Unknown
 *        ok  	govac	0.366s [no tests to run]        EXIT=0
 *        $ go test ./... -run Unknown -v
 *        testing: warning: no tests to run
 *        PASS
 *        ok  	govac	0.180s [no tests to run]        EXIT=0
 *
 *      `-v` prints the word PASS. A deployer running the register's command sees a pass, and a
 *      renamed, moved or deleted test upstream is indistinguishable from a premise that holds.
 *
 *      ⚠ THIS WAS NOT HYPOTHETICAL WHEN THIS GUARD WAS WRITTEN. The register said premise 2 —
 *      "Track answers 200+[] for an unknown workspace and has no 404 branch on
 *      /v1/service/members" — was settled by `go test ./internal/member/ -run Unknown`.
 *      talyvor-track's `internal/member/` holds FIFTEEN test functions at 9cfad34 and NOT ONE
 *      of them matches the regex `Unknown`. The command had been reporting a pass on an
 *      instrument that ran nothing. The premise itself is true and IS tested upstream — by
 *      `TestServiceMembers_NonExistentWorkspace_EmptyAndAudited` in audit_test.go, which
 *      asserts the 200 and the `[]` body directly — so the register named a filter that misses
 *      the very test it is describing.
 *
 * H2 — `grep -c PATTERN FILE` EXITS 0 FOR ANY COUNT ≥ 1, so an expectation written as a
 *      trailing `# expect 2` comment is a human's job, not the command's. Measured:
 *
 *        $ grep -c 'cfg.MemberSyncSecret' one-line-file   → prints 1, EXIT=0
 *        $ [ "$(grep -c 'cfg.MemberSyncSecret' one-line-file)" = 2 ]   → EXIT=1
 *
 *      One secret gating BOTH Track service endpoints is the premise; a count of 1 means it
 *      gates one, and `grep -c` says nothing about that in its exit status.
 *
 * ── THE REPLACEMENT SHAPE, PROVED IN EVERY STATE RATHER THAN REASONED INTO ───
 *
 * A prescription written in a comment is worth nothing until it has been run against the case
 * it claims to catch. On a throwaway module holding the two `TestServiceRoute_*` names and one
 * decoy, with a subtest under the first so the count could be inflated by one:
 *
 *   both present and passing   [ "$(… | grep -c '^--- PASS: TestServiceRoute')" = 2 ]   EXIT 0
 *   the single-test form, test present   … | grep -q '^--- PASS: <Name>'                EXIT 0
 *   the single-test form, test RENAMED AWAY                                             EXIT 1
 *   one of the two FAILING                                                              EXIT 1
 *   one of the two DELETED                                                              EXIT 1
 *   ⚠ the OLD bare form on that same broken tree: ok … [no tests to run]                EXIT 0
 *
 * The last line is the control: on a tree where the named test no longer exists, the shape this
 * file forbids still answers yes. `^` matters — a subtest prints its `--- PASS:` indented, so
 * the anchor is what keeps the count a count of top-level tests.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GUARD DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does NOT prove a settle command is fail-closed. That is not decidable by reading a shell
 * pipeline, and pretending otherwise would be the same mistake one layer up. It pins the TWO
 * SHAPES MEASURED ABOVE to exit 0 on a false premise, and it says so: this is a denylist of
 * measured hazards, and a new command in a new shape is covered by nothing here.
 *
 * It also cannot check that the named upstream test EXISTS — that premise lives in another
 * repository, which is the entire reason these entries are in the uncheckable half. The
 * `--- PASS:` requirement is what makes the DEPLOYER's run answer that question instead.
 *
 * ⚠ THE FLOORS ARE HARDCODED LITERALS AND THEY ARE NOT DECORATION. Every rule below is a loop
 * over a set parsed out of a bash file. Reformat the file, rename the helper, drop the
 * continuation backslashes, and the parse yields ZERO entries — at which point every rule
 * passes, having read nothing, and this file reports a clean register. The two floors are the
 * only things standing between that and a green run, so they name counts rather than deriving
 * one from the parse they are meant to police.

 * Every entry ends with a `   # …` note explaining what was measured. A deployer pastes the
 * whole string and the shell ignores everything after the `#`. The classifiers below did NOT:

 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS LATENT RATHER THAN LIVE, WHICH IS SAID HERE RATHER THAN LEFT IMPLIED. Swept over

 * engine.go:94 names `docs-ai-ask` and `docs-search` in a comment, so a tag deleted from the code
 * and left in the paragraph above it would still be extracted. That is the §D7 trap, and taking

/**
 * R11 — A STRUCT-MIRROR ENTRY ASSERTS THAT THE DECLARATION IS STILL THE WIRE, NOT MERELY THAT
 * THE TAGS DID NOT MOVE.
 *
 * Fifteen entries settle a claim of the form "TrackWorkspace mirrors talyvor-track Workspace" by
 * extracting the json tags out of the struct DECLARATION and comparing the set. That is a proxy,
 * and MEASURED at e4ba7f4 it is a proxy with three holes, every one of which COMPILES and leaves
 * the extracted tag set byte-identical:
 *
 *   · a custom MarshalJSON/UnmarshalJSON on the type, in a NEW file of the same package. Verified
 *     end to end on talyvor-track model.Workspace: `go build ./...` exit 0, `go vet` clean, and
 *     the response becomes {"d7q2_only_key":1} — every declared tag gone from the wire — while
 *     the settle command still reported the mirror as holding. `go test -short ./...` on that
 *     export is identical to baseline; the real-Postgres half was not run and is not claimed.
 *   · an EXPORTED FIELD WITH NO json TAG. encoding/json puts it on the wire under its Go name, and
 *     an extraction that reads `json:"…"` cannot see it. This is the likeliest of the three: a
 *     field added in a hurry.
 *   · an EMBEDDED field, which promotes another type's fields — and its MarshalJSON — onto this
 *     one without a single tag changing here.
 *
 * So each of the fifteen now carries two more clauses: FIELD LINES = TAGGED LINES inside the
 * declaration window (which refuses the untagged field and the embedded one), and NO
 * (Un)MarshalJSON for that type in its package. All 15 hold on read-only `git archive` exports of
 * origin/main, and all 45 mutations — three per entry, run against the command THE REGISTER
 * PRINTS rather than a reconstruction — are caught.
 *
 * ⚠ THE BOUNDARY, STATED SO IT IS NOT OVERQUOTED. This makes the DECLARATION honest about itself.
 * It still cannot see a handler that wraps the struct before writing it, and it is scoped to the
 * declaration-anchored entries — the six request-body entries that extract from an ANONYMOUS
 * struct at a route mount are out of population, and by construction: no method can attach to an
 * anonymous type, so the marshaller hole cannot exist there.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE POPULATION FLOOR IS A HARD LITERAL, NOT A COUNT DERIVED FROM THE SAME PARSE. A rule
 * whose population is computed from the thing it polices agrees with it in every state.

 * — the entire premise, gone — and that command STILL EXITS 0, because a provenance comment 59

 * the thing this register hands a deployer to run before a deploy.

 * ⚠ THE DECLARED SUBJECT IS A CLAIM ABOUT WHAT THE COMMAND READS, AND ONE OF THEM IS FALSE.

 * the cross-repo twin of `subject` in the same script: a deployer who has to re-anchor a settle
 * command reads that list to know which files matter.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ WHY THE 45/45 THAT CAME BEFORE THIS DID NOT SEE IT: IT WAS COUNTED PER ENTRY. tab-r5m2 armed
 * the register "45/45 against their declared subject file being emptied AND deleted" — an entry
 * scores armed as soon as ONE of its subjects reds the command. Re-run per (entry, SUBJECT) pair
 * at docs 313eb86 / track a12e01f / lens f134404 — every command executed in a read-only
 * `git archive` export, each subject emptied AND deleted in turn, restored and sha256-verified
 * back (~/talyvor-queue/w171-subject-arming-census-j8w4.py) — and it is 51 pairs, X0 green on all
 * 45 checkable entries, **50 ARMED and ONE INERT**: entry 5's `migrations/0018_page_own_ai_spend.sql`.
 * Empty it, delete it, and the command still exits 0. An entry-level control cannot see this,
 * because the other two subjects of that same entry red it correctly.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS NOT AN ARTEFACT OF THE HARNESS, WHICH WAS THE FIRST THING CHECKED. A reused test
 * database would explain a green — `internal/migrate` records each migration's checksum, so an
 * already-migrated database never re-reads the file. Re-run against a FRESH database it was still
 * green, and the reason is simpler and worse: `TestAttribution_*` drives a `recordingBinder` fake
 * and a `lensStub` and opens no connection at all. The declared subject is not weakly read. It is
 * read by nothing, on any run, by any route.
 *
 * WHAT IS ENFORCEABLE FROM HERE. This repository's CI clones only itself, so it cannot execute a
 * settle command and cannot watch a subject red one. What it CAN decide is whether a declared
 * subject is reachable AT ALL:
 *
 *   R5 SHAPE       — a subject token is a bare repo-relative path. The register writes its lists
 *                    with TWO separators — `, ` (entry 5) and ` + ` (entries 37/38/39) — and a
 *                    parser that knows only one of them reads three real paths as a single path
 *                    that does not exist. It still ENDS IN `.go`, so a reachability rule would
 *                    wave it through. Whitespace in a token is what makes a third separator fail
 *                    here rather than silently become one unreadable subject.
 *   R6 REACHABILITY— a subject that is not a Go source file must be NAMED in the settle command.
 *                    `go test ./internal/ai/` pulls in `internal/page/ai_spend.go` through the
 *                    build graph without naming it — that is why .go files are exempt and why
 *                    this rule is not "every subject must appear in the command". A .sql file has
 *                    no such route: nothing compiles it. ⚠ THIS IS A POLICY, NOT A LAW OF THE
 *                    UNIVERSE — a test CAN reach a .sql through an `embed.FS`, and this repo
 *                    cannot see that either. The policy is what makes the arming visible from
 *                    here: declare a non-Go subject and name it, so a reader can tell whether it

 * (315/349/428/548) makes all four look stale. They are not: they point at the
 * `callAnthropicViaLens` / `callEmbeddingsViaLens` CALL lines, exactly as that header's arrows
 * say, and all four are correct at both SHAs. A pointer read against the wrong target reports a
 * finding that is not there.
 *
 * WHAT R8 ENFORCES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. This repo's CI clones only itself, so it
 * cannot execute an upstream check — that is the whole reason the `cannot` half exists. What it
 * CAN decide is whether each upstream file a census names is a DECLARED SUBJECT of some settle
 * command, so a deployer running the register is running something that covers it, and so a new
 * census row cannot arrive with nothing in the register pointing at its file. R8 is a
 * reachability rule of exactly the same kind as R6, one repository boundary further out.
