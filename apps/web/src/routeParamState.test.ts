// routeParamState.test.ts — STATE THAT BELONGS TO A ROUTE PARAM MUST BE THROWN AWAY WHEN THE
// PARAM CHANGES.
//
// ── THE DEFECT, THREE TIMES, IN THREE FILES WRITTEN MONTHS APART ─────────────────────────────
//
// React Router matches every value of a param to ONE <Route> element, so A → B changes the param
// underneath the element and does NOT remount it: every `useState` survives. Three screens grew
// this independently and each was found by hand, by whoever happened to be reading the file:
//
//   `f4c1e97` (#190)  areas/docs/PageView.tsx    page A's text saved INTO page B
//   `d82bcfb` (#192)  areas/track/IssueDetail.tsx issue A's words PATCHed onto issue B
//   `ef6ee03` (#193)  areas/docs/SpaceView.tsx    a page created in space B titled for space A
//
// The third was found by a census rather than a reader. This file is that census, kept.
//
// ⚠ WHY A SWEEP AND NOT THREE TESTS. Each of the three HAS a behavioural test that navigates
// A → B and reads the screen, and those tests are the real instruments — they pin what the words
// do, which no text rule can. What they cannot do is speak for a FOURTH screen that does not
// exist yet. The class is closed today at exactly three; the next `useParams` component is one
// file away, and its author has no reason to read any of the three.
//
// ── THE RULE, AND WHAT IT IS NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A component that calls `useParams()` and holds `useState` must, for EACH param it destructures,
// compare a state variable against that param (or against a local const derived from it — which
// is how PageView does it, since its draft belongs to the PAIR `${spaceId}/${pageId}`).
//
// ⚠ IT IS A FLOOR, AND THE LIMIT IS NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE DISCOVERED. It asks whether the
// component KNOWS which param its state belongs to. It cannot ask whether the reset then clears
// the right variables — C2 and C3 in ~/talyvor-queue/w11-spacestate-controls-8b47.py delete one
// `setX` from inside a reset and this rule stays green on both, because the comparison is still
// there. Only the behavioural cases catch those. A guard that claimed otherwise would be worse
// than none.
//
// ⚠ AND `enabled: spaceId !== ''` IS NOT A RESET, WHICH IS THE WHOLE REASON THE COMPARISON MUST
// NAME A STATE VARIABLE. All three files carry param-vs-literal comparisons in their query
// options; a rule that accepted any `!==` touching the param would have passed SpaceView while it
// was creating pages in the wrong space.
