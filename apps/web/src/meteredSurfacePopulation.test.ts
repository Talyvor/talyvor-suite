// meteredSurfacePopulation.test.ts — THE POPULATION THE TWO METERED CENSUSES RUN OVER MUST COME
// FROM THE SOURCE, NOT FROM A LIST SOMEBODY REMEMBERED TO EXTEND.
//
// ── THE DEFECT, MEASURED RATHER THAN REVIEWED ────────────────────────────────
//
// areas/docs/meteredCostCensus.test.tsx and areas/track/meteredCostCensus.test.tsx are two of the
// best-controlled files in this repo — nine, six and eight positive controls between them, each
// naming its predicted catcher first. Both open by arguing that a census is the right SHAPE
// because "a test per card is exactly what leaves the fifth card unwritten": Docs missed
// SearchDocs, Track missed SearchIssues, and both misses were a spending surface that nobody had
// written a test for.
//
// ⚠⚠ AND BOTH CENSUSES ARE KEYED ON A HAND-WRITTEN ARRAY OF COMPONENT NAMES. `METERED` is five
// literal rows in Docs and four in Track. Every control they carry mutates a row that is already
// there. Not one of them can see a surface that was never added — which is the exact failure both
// files were written to end, still open in the direction that produced it.
//
// MEASURED at main `34cf1270`, not reasoned about: a new card `areas/docs/PageDigest.tsx` calling
// `docsApi.summarizePage` — the same billed route PageSummary calls, feature tag
// `docs-ai-summarize` — mounted in PageView.tsx beside its four siblings, printing NO price at
// mount and NO receipt beside the answer. The whole web gauntlet stayed green: typecheck (after
// the card compiled), lint, apps/web 1897 tests, both metered censuses, audit-gate and
// audit-reach. The ONLY line that moved was `packages/ui`'s test-manifest — `invariant.test.ts:
// 128 -> 129 tests`, because that colour sweep generates one test per apps/web source file — and
// its documented remedy is `pnpm test:accept`. A count that a developer is told to accept is not
// a guard against an undisclosed charge.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS ONE FILE AND NOT TWO ───────────────
//
// A surface is metered if its CODE names a route that bills Lens. That is derivable here: the
// marker per route is below, the file scan is below it, and the answer is compared against the
// census that is supposed to be holding that surface to a cost sentence.
//
// It is ONE file covering BOTH areas deliberately. The finding is that a per-area guard cannot
// see the next area, and this repo has paid for that twice already — W1.1.9a records "the fix
// applied where the defect was reported and the identical shape one element over never swept
// for". Docs' own census header says Track's guard "is a good guard and it cannot see this
// directory at all". Writing this twice would reproduce the defect it closes.
//
// ── THE TWO POPULATIONS ARE RESTATED ON PURPOSE, WHICH IS NORMALLY A DEFECT ──
//
// This repo's standing rule is that a derived value beats a restated one. It does not apply here
// and the reason is the whole point: the census's list is DECLARED and this file's list is
// DERIVED FROM SOURCE, so they are two independent measurements of one set. Deriving this one
// from the census would make the comparison a tautology and close nothing.
//
// ── WHY COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// FindDuplicates.tsx names `/api/track/issues/{id}/find-duplicates` in a docstring one line above
// the code that builds it, and PageChangelog.tsx's header names the metered siblings it is NOT
// one of. A detector that reads prose enrols whatever a file talks about. `decision-expiry.sh`
// §D7 records the same trap costing this repo a guard that matched `member-sync` in its own
// comments. The detector is positive-controlled in both directions below before it reads a file.
//
// ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT IN THE POPULATION ───────────────────────────────
//
// `docsApi.generateChangelog` (PageChangelog.tsx) has NO marker because it is not a metered route.
// That is not an omission and it is not this file's judgement: PageChangelog.tsx:15 records the
// measurement — "GenerateFromIssues reaches Lens never", no `own_ai_cost_usd` moves — which is why
// Docs' census names it as its one excluded surface. A route that does not spend has no marker, so
// no exclusion list is needed here, and there is no dead escape hatch for a later surface to hide
// in.
//
// areas/chat is out for the same kind of reason, also measured upstream rather than assumed:
// Chat.tsx:137 records that in the default configuration a session-key request moves no LXC at all
// (talyvor-lens `dd1bb44`), which is why that screen shows a catalog LIST PRICE and refuses to
// claim a bill.

/**
 * ⚠⚠ AN EXCLUSION IS A CLAIM, AND IT IS THE CLAIM IN THIS FILE DOING THE MOST WORK — SO IT IS DATA
 * HERE RATHER THAN THE PROSE IT WAS.
 *
 * Docs' census already states the rule: *"A surface excluded silently is indistinguishable from one
 * forgotten, which is how SearchDocs was missed; excluded surfaces are therefore named here."* They
 * WERE named — in the paragraph above — and naming was as far as it went. Nothing joined an
 * exclusion to anything, and the difference matters most for the one whose premise is not in this
 * repository.
 *
 * ⚠ R8 IN settleCommands.test.ts IS THE RULE THAT EXISTS FOR EXACTLY THIS AND IT CANNOT SEE AN
 * EXCLUSION. It iterates the `upstream:` FIELDS OF CENSUS ROWS, so every INCLUDED surface's
 * upstream call site must be a declared subject of a `cannot` entry — and an excluded area has no
 * row, no field, and therefore no obligation. MEASURED, not inferred: `grep -c` for
 * session-key / SESSION_KEYS / tlv_sk_ / LXCShadow / shadowSpend / agentKeyID across
 * deploy/decision-expiry.sh returns **0** over its 48 uncheckable entries. The newest cross-repo
 * surface in this app is the one the register has never heard of, and the reason is structural: a
 * rule that iterates rows is blind to the rows that were removed.
 *
 * ⚠ THE REPO IS IN THE ROW, WHICH IS THE ONE PLACE THIS DIFFERS FROM THE CENSUSES' OWN `upstream:`
 * SHAPE, AND IT IS NOT AN INCONSISTENCY. settleCommands.test.ts derives a census's repository from
 * the DIRECTORY it lives in (`areas/docs` → talyvor-docs) precisely because a bare path joined
 * across repos scored GREEN with half the register deleted — both repos declare
 * `internal/ai/engine.go`. This file is not inside an area and covers three of them, so no
 * directory names its repository and the row has to.
