/**
 * THE RENDERED-FIGURE AUDIT — what the user actually sees, not what the code called it.
 *
 * `figureFace.test.ts` (#93) reads SOURCE and keys on the NAME OF A FUNCTION: any call matching
 * /usd|cents|cost|price/i, plus every exported `format*` classified by hand. That caught the five
 * `formatUSD` sites. It cannot catch money that never passes through a money-named function, and
 * MEASURED 2026-08-09 at `7e2e9fc` — with figureFace green — this was on screen:
 *
 *     Overview:  ≈ {formatUSD(q.data.usd_value_uusd)}          ← the figure face
 *     Overview:  ≈ ${month.data.current_month_usd.toFixed(2)}  ← the body sans
 *
 * The same "≈ $" treatment, twelve rows apart on the same card, in two typefaces. The second
 * one's only function call is `toFixed`, which is not money-shaped, so rule A never saw it.
 * Spend.tsx renders the identical line. A source rule keyed on names cannot close this without
 * guessing which identifiers are rendered and which are merely referenced — measured: a naive
 * value-name rule flags `pending.usd_cents > 0` (a PREDICATE, whose render two lines below is
 * already on the face) and `keepPreviousData` (which contains "usD").
 *
 * So this rule reads the DOM instead. A figure is a figure because of what it says on screen.
 *
 * ── #95: THE RULE WAS NEVER "EVERY MONEY FIGURE". IT IS "EVERY NUMERAL". ─────────────────────
 *
 * preset.ts §THE FIGURE FACE, written by #88, says it in one line: "Every numeral in the product
 * renders here." The brief it was ported from says MONOSPACE FOR EVERY NUMERAL. Three merges then
 * swept for MONEY — #93 by name, #94 by `$` on screen — and nothing ever asked about a figure that
 * is not money. MEASURED at `565bdc0` with both guards green, by recording every rendered element
 * whose own text is a figure and nothing else: 139 such elements, 131 on the face, FOUR SOURCE
 * SITES off it, and every one of them a quantity rather than a price:
 *
 *     ConvertLens  Rate: <span class="text-ink">{lens_per_lxc}</span> LENS per LXC     ← the sans
 *     ConvertLens  minimum <span class="text-ink">{microsToUnits(min_lxc_ulxc)}</span> ← the sans
 *     CacheCard    <span class="font-mono …">{cache_hits.toLocaleString()}</span>      ← no tnum
 *     CacheCard    <span class="text-body text-muted">≈ {hit_rate*100}%</span>         ← the sans
 *
 * ⚠ THE LAST ONE IS THE ARGUMENT. `≈ <derived value>` in a muted caption is a shape this product
 * renders in four places — Overview, Spend, TopUp, BillingReturn — and in all four it is
 * `font-figure text-body text-muted`. CacheCard renders the same shape one class short. That is
 * not a fifth opinion about hit rates; it is the same treatment, missed.
 *
 * ⚠ AND WHY THIS IS STILL NOT A SOURCE RULE — the question W1.1 left for this merge was whether to
 * classify `microsToUnits` instead. MEASURED: that closes exactly ONE of the four. `lens_per_lxc`
 * is a bare field read with no call at all; the other two go through `toLocaleString` and
 * `Math.round`, which are also how identifiers and step indices are rendered. Classifying those
 * two would police every call site of two JavaScript builtins to reach two figures. The DOM knows
 * which of them ended up as a figure on screen; the source does not.
 *
 * ⚠ TRAP ONE — REACT SPLITS THE TEXT NODE. `≈ ${x}` renders as TWO text nodes, "≈ $" and
 * "12.35". A per-text-node /\$\s*\d/ finds neither, so the first version of this audit passed
 * clean over both defects. It reads an element's OWN text — its direct text children joined —
 * which is the smallest unit that can carry a typeface. Pinned by a control below.
 *
 * ⚠ TRAP TWO — A SENTENCE IS NOT A FIGURE. The one sans-rendered currency text in the product at
 * `7e2e9fc` is a REFUSAL FROM LENS that TopUp surfaces verbatim — "this app offers $10, $50,
 * $100, but Lens refused that amount — the two are running different top-up allow-lists." Prose
 * that quotes a price is prose; digits ride the sentence, in the sans, the same argument that
 * keeps `formatWhen` and `formatDay` off the face. So an element is
 * policed only when its own text is A FIGURE AND NOTHING ELSE — remove the figures and their
 * decoration and nothing may be left. ⚠ THAT CARVE-OUT IS WHAT KEEPS THE BROADENED RULE HONEST
 * rather than what weakens it: measured over the whole suite, it leaves 189 digit-bearing
 * elements unpoliced — every date ("Jul 19, 17:52"), every issue ref ("TAL-1"), every key prefix
 * ("tlv_ws_7c0ffee0"), every window button ("7d"), every counted sentence ("8 requests recorded
 * in the last 30 days"). A figure with a WORD beside it inside one element is prose. A figure
 * alone in its own element is a figure, and ConvertLens gives its rate its own span.

 * was `font-mono`, and W1.1's own note that "the 20 font-mono call sites are IDENTIFIERS, not
 * figures" was true of sixteen of the seventeen.
 *
 * ⚠ BUT THE REASON WRITTEN HERE WAS FALSE, AND THE CORRECTION IS THE PART WORTH KEEPING. This
 * said `font-mono` is "the same family without tnum, and a column of figures that does not align
 * is the defect". MEASURED off the shipped binaries (glyphAudit.test.tsx pins it): the served IBM
 * Plex Mono subsets declare NO `tnum` feature at all, so `font-figure`'s
 * `font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1` has nothing to switch on — and all ten digits in those subsets
 * already advance 600 units, so a `font-mono` column ALIGNS. The two utilities are
 * rendering-identical in the browser. The SANS is the one with `tnum` and nine distinct digit
 * advances, which is presumably where the sentence came from before numerals moved to mono.
 *
 * ⚠ THE RULE IS UNCHANGED AND DELIBERATELY SO. One named utility for figures is still worth
 * having, and narrowing or widening it is a design decision, not a correction. What is corrected
 * is the claim that the browser can see the difference: it cannot, so this rule buys CONSISTENCY,
 * not alignment, and should be argued on that.
