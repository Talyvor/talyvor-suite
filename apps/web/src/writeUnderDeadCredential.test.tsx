// writeUnderDeadCredential.test.tsx — WHAT A BUTTON SAYS WHEN THE CREDENTIAL IS DEAD.
//
// SessionExpired.test.tsx already sweeps this state, and it is structurally blind to the half
// measured here: every one of its cases is an ADDRESS with PANELS that read. Nothing in it
// presses a button, and a mutation's error never enters the query cache, so the mechanism that
// makes the reads honest cannot reach the writes at all. Twelve `useMutation` call sites ship
// in this app and one of them — Documents.tsx — states the rule:
//
//     "You can try again" is true of a blip and false of a dead credential, and under the bar
//     it is a third voice giving a remedy that contradicts the one already on screen. The
//     OUTCOME still has to be stated either way — the reader pressed a button and needs to
//     know it did not take — so ONLY THE ADVICE MOVES.
//
// MEASURED before this file existed, real `<App/>`, real shipped queryClient, /auth/me
// authenticated and every /api/* answering 401 — the live condition, since the BFF session
// outlives the workspace token by four hours (tenant.go: 8h token, 12h session):
//
//   /keys   press "Create key"     bar visible   panel: "Couldn't mint the key. Please try again."
//   /track  press "Create issue"   bar visible   panel: "Couldn't create that issue — nope"
//
// The first is the contradiction the rule names. The SECOND is worse and is not a missing
// branch: IssueList classifies a refusal as retryable on `status >= 500`, so a 401 lands in the
// "the same request will be refused forever, not as sent" bucket and the screen prints the
// upstream's raw error string as advice about the request. Nothing about that request was
// wrong. And `CreateRefusal` did not extend `ApiError`, so `isSessionExpired` — the shared
// predicate one import away — could not see it, which is exactly the defect #136 fixed for a
// READ (`readDistill` threw a bare Error) arriving on the write path.
//
// THE THREE STATES STAY THREE, and that is asserted in both directions here: a 500 keeps its
// remedy, and a 400 carrying an upstream sentence still shows that sentence verbatim — the
// behaviour IssueList's CreateRefusal was written for.

// ── THE CONDITION THE FIXTURE ABOVE CANNOT PRODUCE, AND THE SURFACES IT CANNOT REACH ─────────
//
// `mockAllApi` answers EVERY /api/* with the same status, so a 401 case refuses the READS too.
// That is a real state — but it is not the one this file's own header describes. The header says
// the workspace token dies four hours before the BFF session (tenant.go: 8h token, 12h session),
// and a token that dies mid-session leaves the reads ALREADY SATISFIED in the query cache. The
// screen the reader is looking at is fully populated. Then they press a button.
//
// TWO THINGS FOLLOW, BOTH MEASURED AT `d7652cf` WITH ALL 1134 TESTS GREEN:
//
// 1. ⚠ THE SURFACES TABLE CANNOT REACH A WRITE THAT ONLY EXISTS AFTER A SUCCESSFUL READ.
//    `/keys` and `/track` render their forms whether or not the list read succeeded, which is why
//    those two are drivable under an all-401 fixture. IssueDetail's "Save description" and
//    "Comment" buttons are inside `if (!it) return …`, so under all-401 there is no button to
//    press. The two write surfaces on that screen were therefore not merely absent from the table
//    — they were UNREACHABLE BY ITS FIXTURE SHAPE, which is why adding a row would not have found
//    them.
//    ⚠ THE SENTENCE THAT STOOD HERE NAMED THE COPY — "the screen renders 'That issue could not be
//    read.'" — and W1.1.8 retired it: a 401 now says only "Unavailable.", because that screen's
//    four failure states used to share one sentence. The STRUCTURAL claim this paragraph rests on
//    is the `if (!it) return` and is unchanged, so the reasoning stands; the quoted string was the
//    perishable half and is removed rather than re-quoted.
//
// 2. ⚠ AND THE PREMISE THE RULE RESTS ON IS FALSE HERE. The rule is "only the advice moves,
//    because the bar already carries the remedy" — and the block above ASSERTS the bar is on
//    screen. It is, in that fixture, because the READS 401'd and a read error is what
//    `useSessionExpired` derives from. When only the WRITE is refused, nothing puts an error in
//    the query cache (a mutation's error never enters it, and these two write paths are not even
//    mutations), so THE BAR IS ABSENT — measured absent for /keys, for the description save and
//    for the comment post. That is pinned below rather than asserted as correct: it is a gap in
//    the mechanism, not a property to preserve, and it is recorded so the day the bar learns to
//    see a refused write, this pin reds and gets re-argued instead of quietly kept.
//
// WHAT THAT LEFT ON SCREEN, MEASURED: the description save and the comment post rendered
// "…You can try again." for a 401 — BYTE-IDENTICAL to their 500 — because both write paths
// `throw new Error(String(res.status))` and then `catch {}` DISCARD the error, so the sentence is
// chosen with no error in hand at all. `isSessionExpired` is imported in that very file and used
// 200 lines below for the comments READ. `errorTypes.test.ts` could not see it either: its rule
// matches class DECLARATIONS, and states the exclusion is safe because "a `new Error()` with
// fields bolted on … is not what any of the five instances looked like" — these two are exactly
// that shape, a bare Error carrying the status, on a write path in the same area as three of the
// five.
