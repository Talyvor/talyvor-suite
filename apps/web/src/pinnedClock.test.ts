/**
 * A TEST THAT RENDERS A CLOCK-TAKING SCREEN WITHOUT PINNING THE CLOCK IS A TEST WITH AN EXPIRY DATE.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS ONE HAD ALREADY GONE OFF, ON MAIN, WITH CI GREEN. Measured at `e3b65ef`:
 *
 *     apps/web/src/areas/lens/lxcSplitCoverage.test.tsx:136
 *       renderScreen(<Overview />)          // ← no `now`
 *
 * `Overview({ now = new Date() })` falls back to the WALL CLOCK, and every LXC row that test stubs
 * is `created_at: '2026-07-21T10:00:00Z'`. The screen sums a 30-DAY WINDOW, so the fixture sat
 * inside it until 2026-08-20 and outside it from 2026-08-21 — `lxc-debit-total` renders `2,100µlxc`
 * on one day and `0µlxc` on the next, with NO COMMIT IN BETWEEN.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE INSTRUMENT AGREED IT WAS FINE, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH KEEPING. `gh run list` on
 * `e3b65ef` reports ci=success, created 2026-08-19T17:07:03Z — the last day the assertion could
 * pass. From 2026-08-21 the tree was red and every session that read "main is green" read a fact
 * about WHEN CI LAST RAN, not about the tree it was branching from. STEP 0 says "report main AND
 * its CI conclusion"; this file exists because that conclusion has a shelf life and nothing said so.
 *
 * ⚠ THE OTHER ONE HAD NOT GONE OFF YET, AND THAT IS WHY THIS IS A SWEEP RATHER THAN TWO PATCHES.
 * `Held.test.tsx` renders `<Overview />` unpinned too, and it passes today only because its
 * fixture stubs an EMPTY ledger, so no row can fall out of a window — it is the same defect
 * holding a blank round, and it arms itself the moment anyone gives that fixture a dated row.
 * Measured population at `e3b65ef`: 20 renders of a clock-taking component across the test tree,
 * 18 pinned, 2 not.
 *
 * ── WHY THE COMPONENT SET IS DERIVED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A hardcoded ['Overview', 'Spend'] would guard the two screens someone thought of and say nothing
 * about the third. The set is read out of the SOURCE — any component whose signature defaults a
 * `now` parameter to `new Date()` — so a new clock-taking screen is swept the day it is written,
 * and a screen that STOPS taking a clock drops out without leaving a stale rule behind.
 *
 * ⚠ PAIRED WITH FLOORS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, because a derived sweep's usual failure is finding
 * nothing and reporting no violations: the component set must be non-empty AND must still contain
 * the two screens this was measured on, and the render census must still find renders. If someone
 * renames the prop, this file goes RED rather than quiet.
