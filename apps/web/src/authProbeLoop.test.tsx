/**
 * WHEN `/auth/me` FAILS, THE CONSOLE RENDERED NOTHING — FOR AS LONG AS THE BFF WAS DOWN.
 *
 * `AuthGate` states the intended behaviour in its own comment: "a probe failure falls through to
 * the app, whose routes already render calm per-card failure states (a dead BFF is a fault, not a
 * sign-in prompt)". MEASURED: it did not fall through. It rendered an EMPTY `#root` and re-probed
 * the dead BFF about twice a second, indefinitely.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED IN REAL CHROME ON THE BUILT ARTIFACT, `/auth/me` failed three different ways —
 * `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, 502, and 500. All three identical: `#root` innerHTML length 0 at
 * every sample for 30 seconds, 39 probe requests in 20s. A MutationObserver on `#root` (rather
 * than polling, so an oscillation faster than a poll interval could not hide) recorded 9 subtree
 * mutations whose maximum content length was ZERO — the tree churned and never once held content.
 * The SAME harness answering the probe: ONE request, content in 118ms.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT REPRODUCES HERE, against the real `<App/>` and the real exported `queryClient`:
 * 78 fetches in 4 seconds, `status` sampled `pending` and `fetchStatus` `fetching` every time
 * while the query cache recorded 70 `updated:error` events in the same window — it errored
 * seventy times and was restarted seventy times, so it never reached the error state a consumer
 * can see. `observerAdded` 85 / `observerRemoved` 84 is the shell mounting and unmounting.
 *
 * ⚠ THE CAUSE, ISOLATED TO ONE COMPONENT — same gate, same production client, one child changed:
 *       children = <div>APP CONTENT</div>                 ->  11 chars, status=error,  2 fetches
 *       children = <div>APP CONTENT<SessionChip/></div>   ->   0 chars, status=pending, climbing
 * React Query's `retryOnMount` defaults to TRUE, so an observer mounting onto an ERRORED query
 * starts a fresh fetch. The gate errored, fell through, the shell mounted `SessionChip`, its
 * observer restarted the probe, the gate returned to `isLoading` and rendered `null`, and the
 * shell — with `SessionChip` in it — unmounted. Round again. `lib/authMe.ts` carries the fix and
 * the rule: a reader may not restart a probe it does not own.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT. `AuthGate.test.tsx` builds its OWN `new QueryClient({ queries: {
 * retry: false } })` rather than importing the app's. The production retry predicate, the
 * `QueryCache.onError` handler and this interaction are exercised by no test in this repo. These
 * cases use the REAL exported client on purpose, and clear it between them — that singleton
 * answering a later case is `#122`'s vacuity trap and it is live in this file.

/**
 * THE ENUMERATION'S OTHER INPUT: WHICH FILES IT READS, AND IT WAS THE UNCONTROLLED ONE.
 *
 * The case below is careful about its unit of measurement — per call site, not per file, because
 * the per-file version stayed green through the exact mutation it exists for. It was not careful
 * about its POPULATION: the walk decides which files the `DECL` regex ever meets, and the case's
 * output for "read nothing" is byte-identical to its output for "read everything and found only
 * the two owners".
 *
 * MEASURED at db85e4d on the real tree, not reasoned about
 * (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-blindwalk-controls-9e73.py` and `w11-blindwalk-armed-9e73.py`, every
 * mutation anchor-count-asserted before the edit, restored in a `finally` and verified back by
 * sha256, verdicts read from vitest's own per-test lines):
 *   A1  a second raw `queryKey: ['auth-me'], queryFn: api.me` reader — the declaration whose
 *       duplication made the console render nothing — added to a real screen at
 *       `areas/lens/Ledger.tsx`: REDS this case, and only this case.
 *   A2  THE HOLE: the same new reader, plus ONE line so the walk does not descend into `areas` —
 *       rc=0, GREEN. 43 of the 70 production files under apps/web/src live there, and `areas/`
 *       is where THREE OF THE FOUR readers named above live (`Setup`, `Sharing`, `legalParts`
 *       are the other holders of this observer). The enumeration existed to speak for exactly
 *       those, and one line took them out of its sight.
 *   C3  the skip ALONE, no new reader: GREEN. Nothing anywhere notices the population shrank.
 *
 * That is #183's C1/C2/C3, in this file. #183 closed it in `lib/awaiting.test.ts` and named the
 * three sweeps it had not been run against; this is one of them.
 *
 * THE REPAIR IS #183's AND IT IS THRESHOLD-FREE — an INDEPENDENT ENUMERATION. `import.meta.glob`
 * is resolved by Vite at transform time and touches `node:fs` not at all, so a skip map, a
 * changed extension filter or a wrong anchor cannot move both instruments the same way. Compared
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS, with a floor for the one failure that CAN move both: an anchor resolving to an
 * empty tree leaves the two enumerations agreeing on nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ THE WALK IS HOISTED SO BOTH CASES READ THE SAME ONE. A traversal written inside the new case
 * to produce the expected set would be a second walk, free to drift from the one under test —
 * which is this defect again, one level up.
 *
 * ⚠ IT PASSED ON ITS FIRST RUN, so every assertion in it has its own control and every verdict is
 * read from the FAILING TEST NAME rather than from the file's exit code
 * (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-blindwalk-guard-controls-9e73.py`, 7/7):
 *   P1 walk skips `areas/` → the SET comparison reds and it is the ONLY newly-failing case, so the
 *      catch is this block's and not the enumeration below noticing.
 *   P2 the glob pattern pointed at a directory that does not exist → the FLOOR *and* the SET red,
 *      so the floor is armed rather than decorative.
 *   P3 the walk widened to keep `.test.*` → the SET reds AS EXPECTED, and it also reds the
 *      enumeration below. ⚠ RECORDED RATHER THAN PREDICTED AWAY: `DECL` matches raw source text,
 *      and the A1 paragraph above QUOTES a declaration verbatim, so widening the walk makes this
 *      file report its own prose as a call site. The enumeration is kept off its own fixtures by
 *      the walk's test-file exclusion and by NOTHING ELSE — the same limit #183 recorded for
 *      `lib/awaiting.test.ts`, which is the sibling of this repair.
 *   P4 the duplicate-reader defect with the walk intact → the ORIGINAL case reds ALONE and the SET
 *      stays green, so the repair was ADDED to the enumeration rather than swapped in for it.
 *   P5 the A2 combination → CAUGHT. The flip is the finding.
 *   P6 BLINDING: this block skipped and the A2 defect restored → rc=0, NOT CAUGHT. Nothing else
 *      in the repo was watching.
 *   G1 a new production file that both instruments can see → STAYS GREEN. It is a set comparison,
 *      not a snapshot of a file list somebody would have to re-baseline.
