/**
 * A COUNT IN A SENTENCE IS A FACT ABOUT THE QUERY BEFORE IT IS ONE ABOUT THE PRODUCT.
 *
 * `89bd58d` (#99) wrote the number of `uppercase` call sites down FOUR TIMES IN THREE FILES and
 * wrote THREE DIFFERENT NUMBERS, in one commit:
 *
 *     caseAudit.ts   "there are TWENTY uppercase call sites in the two packages"
 *     caseAudit.ts   "`uppercase` (25 call sites) and `normal-case` (1) are spelled out"
 *     CaseSafe.tsx   "while twenty other `uppercase` class lists took their text from props"
 *     MuNumeral.tsx  "while twenty other `uppercase` class lists took their text from props"
 *
 * None of the four says WHAT IT COUNTED, and that — not the arithmetic — is the defect. Measured
 * at `dc0bd07`, the tree #99 was looking at when it wrote all three, by running the census below
 * against `git archive dc0bd07 | tar -x`:
 *
 *     every occurrence of the word `uppercase`, tests excluded, COMMENTS KEPT      25 / 13 files
 *     every occurrence of the word `uppercase`, tests excluded, comments blanked   21 / 12 files
 *     occurrences that APPLY the class — a quoted class list                       21 / 12 files
 *     … the same, minus MuNumeral's own, which the sentence is contrasting against 20
 *
 * So all three numbers are the SAME MEASUREMENT under three unstated queries: 25 counts the
 * PARAGRAPHS ABOUT the class alongside the uses of it, 21 counts the uses, and 20 is 21 minus the
 * one being contrasted. "twenty other" (CaseSafe, MuNumeral) is exactly right. "TWENTY … call
 * sites in the two packages" is the same figure with the word `other` dropped, so it is wrong by
 * one. "25" is right for a query nobody would want here.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE DISAGREEMENT WAS UNFALSIFIABLE BECAUSE THE HONEST NUMBER NEVER MOVES. Measured at
 * three SHAs with the census below:
 *
 *                                              dc0bd07   89bd58d   5ba9846
 *     class-list call sites                        21        21        21
 *     word `uppercase`, comments blanked           21        25        29
 *     word `uppercase`, comments kept              25        54        71
 *
 * The product has not gained an `uppercase` call site in three merges. What grew is the PROSE
 * about it — this file's subject matter is a class whose whole story is written in comments, so
 * the raw-word count decays with documentation rather than with the product. A reader re-deriving
 * "25" today gets 71, and would conclude the count had tripled.
 *
 * ── THE UNIT, DECIDED AND STATED RATHER THAN LEFT TO THE READER ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * An `uppercase` CALL SITE is one occurrence of the token `uppercase`, whitespace-delimited,
 * inside a QUOTED FRAGMENT in comment-blanked source of the two packages with test files
 * excluded — a place that APPLIES the class, as opposed to one that NAMES it. That is the only
 * unit under which caseAudit.ts's sentence ("it is applied at the call site … and that is the
 * whole problem") means anything: counting the paragraphs that discuss the class inflates the
 * problem with its own documentation.
 *
 * The seven occurrences that NAME the class are classified in NAMES_THE_CLASS below rather than
 * filtered out, so narrowing the census cannot silently under-report.
 *
 * ── WHY THE PIN READS THE NUMBER OUT OF THE FILE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each claim's cardinal is PARSED FROM THE SOURCE LINE and compared to the live census. A table
 * that merely restated the number would compare a constant to itself and pass for every value —
 * this repo has shipped that guard once already. `states` in the table is the expected PARSE, so
 * editing the sentence's number reds against the table AND against the census, from both ends.
 *
 * ── LIVE vs PAST, AND WHY PAST IS NOT A FREE PASS ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * CaseSafe.tsx and MuNumeral.tsx narrate the world BEFORE the fix ("was the ONLY site … while
 * twenty other class lists took their text from props"). A past-tense count cannot be checked
 * against today's census — if a 22nd call site lands, "twenty other" stays true about `dc0bd07`
 * and a live assertion would red on correct prose. So a PAST claim is checked against the number
 * this merge MEASURED at its SHA and recorded here, and the bytes of those two sentences are left
 * alone: they are correct, and the queue's own precedent for a correct past measurement is to
 * leave it (`planes.ts` and `NavItem.tsx` still say "five" for the same reason).
 *
 * The pin is not a free pass either. A PAST entry must still match its sentence verbatim, so any
 * edit to one of those two sentences reds and has to be re-argued; and the SWEEP below means a
 * claim cannot be filed as PAST by simply not listing it.
 *
 * ── THE FLOOR, BOTH DIRECTIONS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The sweep finds every count-of-uppercase-call-sites sentence in the two packages and is
 * compared to the table as a SET. A new one anywhere is unclassified and fails; a deleted one
 * leaves a stale entry and fails. A source-derived sweep cannot see a deletion and a pinned list
 * cannot see an addition, so this holds both — `5ba9846`'s shape, met again.
 *
 * ── LIMITS, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  · This pins the NUMBER a sentence states. It does not pin the rest of the sentence: "took
 *    their text from props" is a characterisation of the same 20 sites and nothing here checks it.
 *  · The PAST measurements are RECORDED, not re-derived — CI checks out one commit and cannot
 *    read `dc0bd07`. They were taken at merge time with this file's own census over
 *    `git archive`, and the command is written above so anyone can repeat it.
 *  · The census reads QUOTED fragments. A class list assembled at runtime (`'text-' + 'eyebrow'`)
 *    is invisible to it, exactly as it is to eyebrowAudit's source half.

  // ⚠ 21 → 23: W1.1.1 rebuilt Overview into labelled regions, and the two new class lists are the

  // about it, so they move the honest number. This is the FIRST time the class-list census has
  // moved at all (it read 21 at three consecutive SHAs above), which is exactly the property the
  // file argues for: the count tracks the product and not the prose about it.
  // ⚠ 23 → 24: W1.1.4 rebuilt Billing the same way. Exactly ONE new class list — the step label
  // on the empty state's "how a balance arrives" list (areas/lens/TopUp.tsx §WaysToGetCredit).
  // The region eyebrows on all three /billing* addresses go through components/Region.tsx, which
  // was already counted, so a screen rebuild moves this by the number of NEW labels it writes and
  // not by the number of regions it draws — which is the second time that has now been true.
  // ⚠ 24 → 26: W1.1.5 rebuilt Keys, and it adds TWO where Billing added one — the empty state's
  // two step labels are written out as literal JSX rather than mapped from an array, so each is
  // its own class list. That is the honest reading of the same rule: the census counts class
  // LISTS, and one `.map` over two steps is one list while two hand-written steps are two.
  // ⚠ 27 → 30: W4.6.1 step 6 added /chat, and it adds THREE — the two field labels ("Model",
  // "Your message") and the per-turn speaker label. Its two region eyebrows go through
  // components/Region.tsx, which was already counted, so the fifth consecutive rebuild again moves
  // this by the number of NEW labels the screen writes rather than by the number of regions it draws.
  // ⚠ 26 → 27: W1.1.6 rebuilt Members, and it adds exactly ONE — the "You" marker on the row whose
  // email is the session's (areas/lens/Members.tsx). The row's ROLE span was already counted and
  // the three region eyebrows go through components/Region.tsx, which was too, so once again a
  // screen rebuild moves this by the number of NEW labels it writes rather than by the number of
  // regions it draws. That is now the fourth consecutive rebuild for which that has held.
  //
  // 30 → 32 at W4.6.1 step 7: /earnings adds TWO — the per-row `kind` label and its breakdown
  // table's head row — and its three region eyebrows again go through components/Region.tsx. Fifth
  // consecutive rebuild, same rule. The prediction is now worth stating as one: a screen built from
  // Region moves this census by the number of labels it writes ITSELF, so a rebuild that moves it
  // by more than that is applying the transform by hand somewhere and should be looked at.
  //
  // 32 → 33 at B1.3: chat history adds ONE — the rename field's label. Its region eyebrow goes
  // through Region.tsx. Sixth consecutive rebuild, same rule.
  //
  // 33 → 40 at B4.1: the Cycles screen writes SEVEN labels itself — Team, Name, Starts, Ends, the
  // card's "Cycle N", "In this cycle" and "Add from this team"; its three region eyebrows go
  // through Region.tsx. Seventh consecutive screen for which the rule held.
  //
  // 40 → 44 at B4.2: the Projects screen writes FOUR labels itself — Team, Name, Identifier and
  // Description; its regions' eyebrows go through Region.tsx. Eighth.
  //
  // 44 → 46 at B5.2: /pricing's rate-card eyebrow ("One credit") and its footer line, both copied
  // from Landing's instrument markings. Its section labels go through Landing's SectionLabel.
  //
  // 46 → 43 at B10.3: the chat dropped four labels it set itself — the turn label (You / the
  // model), "Your message", "Model" and "Conversation name", now sr-only or gone — and gained one,
  // a code block's language label.
  //
  // 43 → 44 at B13.3: each plan card's eyebrow on /plans (Plus / Pro / Max), /pricing's rate-card
  // eyebrow copied.

  //

  // band's eyebrow and the four verbs of the verb stack, less the header's product label (the drawn
