/**
 * THE READER'S FONT SIZE IS A SETTING THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT READ.
 *
 * Every browser has a default-font-size preference — Chrome's Appearance ▸ Font size, Firefox's
 * Fonts ▸ Size, Safari's, Edge's. It is the setting a person who cannot read 14px type changes
 * FIRST, before they reach for zoom, because it is the one that follows them across every site.
 * With no author rule on the root element, that preference IS `font-size` on `<html>`, which is
 * what `rem` resolves against. Declare a type scale in `px` and the preference reaches nothing.
 *
 * MEASURED IN REAL CHROME on the built artifact at `c4a7aa4`, served over HTTP with a BFF stub,
 * by moving the root font-size from 16px (the default) to 24px (Chrome's "Very Large") and
 * recomputing `font-size` on every element carrying a text node:
 *
 *     /            48 text elements     0 changed        /docs        20    0 changed
 *     /ledger      26                   0 changed        /privacy     68    0 changed
 *     /billing     26                   0 changed        /terms       57    0 changed
 *     /setup       88                   0 changed        /marketing  106    0 changed
 *     /keys        28   /spend  34   /members  20   /settings  44   /track  29   — 0 changed
 *
 * 488 elements behind the gate and on the public pages, and NOT ONE of them moved.
 *
 * ⚠ THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS IN THE SAME SAMPLE. A `<div style="font-size:1rem">` appended to
 * each page read 16px before and 24px after, on every address — so the instrument reads a
 * response when there is one to read, and the zero above is the product's answer, not the
 * probe's.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE LAYOUT DID RESPOND, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS AN OVERSIGHT RATHER THAN A DECISION.
 * Tailwind's spacing scale is in `rem` and this product uses it everywhere, so on /marketing the
 * same root change moved 27 boxes and grew the document from 5392px to 6301px (+17%) — the gaps
 * inflate, the type does not. A console that had deliberately pinned its density would have
 * pinned its spacing too.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two declarations decide the answer for the whole product:
 *
 *   · `preset.ts` §fontSize — the six CONSOLE steps, which every screen behind the gate, both
 *     front doors and both legal pages are written in.
 *   · `theme.css` `body { font-size }` — the base every element WITHOUT a `text-*` class
 *     inherits. Five of /setup's 88 text elements were exactly that case: converting the six
 *     steps alone left them at 14px.
 *
 * Both must be ROOT-RELATIVE, and each must still resolve to the px it resolved to before at a
 * 16px root — the point is that the design is unchanged for a reader who changed nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ `em` IS NOT ROOT-RELATIVE AND IS REFUSED HERE. It resolves against the PARENT, so a token
 * used inside another token's element compounds; `rem` is the only unit that means "the reader's
 * size" wherever it is written.
 *
 * ── THE MARKETING STEPS STAY IN px, AND THAT IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED ────────────────────────
 *
 * The other six steps are the public page's display scale (preset.ts §DISPLAY, "⚠ NOT FOR THE
 * APP"). Converting them TOO was measured in the same session, at 320px CSS width with a 24px
 * root: /marketing's document scrollWidth went to 346 against a 320 client width, from a
 * `flex-1 whitespace-nowrap` section tab 388px wide. So they are classified here as px-anchored
 * with the measurement attached rather than converted on the way past. Every step in the scale
 * must appear in exactly one of the two tables below — a new step fails until someone places it,
 * a deleted one fails as stale, and a step that changes side fails with the number to re-measure.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT NO TEST IN THIS REPO CAN SEE, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED: jsdom does not resolve
 * lengths. `getComputedStyle(el).fontSize` returns the SPECIFIED string — `'0.875rem'` stays
 * `'0.875rem'` and `'14px'` stays `'14px'`, at any root size. A rendered-size assertion in this
 * project would therefore pass identically before and after this fix. The last case below
 * measures that and pins it, so nobody writes one believing it guards this. The Chrome rows
 * above are the proof; this file guards the two declarations they trace back to.

/**
 * ⚠ THE THIRD KIND, AND IT EXISTS BECAUSE FILING IT UNDER EITHER OF THE OTHER TWO WOULD LIE.
 *
 * `page` (W1.1.0) is `clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 38px)`: a root-relative FLOOR with a hard px CEILING.
 * It is not root-relative — the table above would demand the whole declaration parse as rem — and
 * it is not px-anchored either, which is the half that matters. It was WRITTEN px-anchored, on
 * §DISPLAY's reasoning, and that shipped a regression invisible at the default root:
 *
 *     at 320px CSS width          root 16px    root 20px    root 24px
 *     title (1.5rem)              24px         30px         36px

 *     page as clamp(1.5rem,…)     24px         30px  ✓       36px  ✓
 *
 * A reader on Chrome's "Very Large" saw the page heading SHRINK when it was promoted from
 * `title`. The floor is now `title`'s own declaration, so the two cannot drift apart at any root.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE CEILING MUST STAY px. In rem, a large-root reader would push the console's biggest
 * type past `display-2`'s 38px — the site's own cap — which is the one thing the ceiling is for.
