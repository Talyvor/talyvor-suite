/**
 * THE CASE AUDIT — a casing transform must not REPLACE a character it was only asked to re-case.
 *
 * preset.ts §THE EYEBROW writes this rule down and then hands enforcement to nobody:
 *
 *     ⚠ THE UPPERCASE IS NOT IN HERE, deliberately. `text-transform: uppercase` maps
 *     µ (U+00B5) to Greek capital Mu, and µLENS/µLXC sit inside these labels. It is applied
 *     at the call site, where MuNumeral can keep its µ in a `normal-case` span.
 *
 * "It is applied at the call site" is true and is the whole problem: 129 uppercase class lists in
 * the two packages apply it, against exactly ONE `normal-case` in the product (CaseSafe.tsx:85).
 * The rule was stated in the token that deliberately does NOT carry the transform, so the one
 * file that could not enforce it is the only file that documents it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT COSTS, MEASURED IN A REAL ENGINE RATHER THAN REASONED ABOUT ──────────────────────
 *
 * Chrome 151, `text-transform: uppercase` over source `µLXC`, in a proportional face, measured by
 * the width of the text run and confirmed by screenshot:
 *
 *     uppercase, source µLXC              184.531px   renders MLXC
 *     no transform, source µLXC           162.250px   renders µLXC
 *     no transform, source ΜLXC (U+039C)  184.531px   renders MLXC   ← byte-identical to the first
 *     uppercase, µ in a normal-case span  162.250px   renders µLXC   ← the fix
 *     uppercase, source lxc               (LXC)                      ← the transform IS live
 *
 * So the shipped page does not render a stylised µ. It renders a DIFFERENT CHARACTER: U+039C
 * GREEK CAPITAL MU, which on a page quoting ledger amounts reads as the SI prefix `M`. µLXC is
 * 1e-6 LXC; MLXC reads as 1e+6 LXC. The public marketing page renders its four measured ledger
 * figures — the ones whose whole purpose is to be checkable against the ledger — labelled twelve
 * orders of magnitude away from the unit they are in.
 *
 * ⚠ AND textContent CANNOT SEE IT. `text-transform` is a paint-time transform; the DOM keeps the
 * source string. Measured above: the uppercase node's `textContent` is still "µLXC". So every
 * existing assertion in this suite that matches on text — `getByText('µLXC list')` and the whole
 * `MUST_RENDER_*` family — passes over this defect and always would have. That is why this rule
 * reads CLASSES and applies the transform itself, and it is the reason a rendered-text audit could
 * not have found it.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT A SOURCE RULE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The `uppercase` and the µ are in different places and neither knows about the other.
 * Landing.tsx:70 is `<span className="font-figure text-eyebrow uppercase text-label">`, and line 70
 * hands its {unit} to CaseSafe — no µ near either. The µ arrives as a PROP from six call sites
 * (`unit="µLXC list"`, `"µLXC charged"`, `"µLXC saved"`, `"µLENS earned"`, `"µLXC you pay"`,
 * `"µLXC kept"`). No grep for "µ near uppercase" connects a prop to the class list that will
 * inherit onto it, and `text-transform` INHERITS, so the answer also depends on which ancestor is
 * nearest. The DOM is where the class and the character finally meet.
 *
 * ── THE PREDICATE, AND WHY IT IS NOT "uppercase IS BAD" ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `uppercase` on `lxc` is correct and intended; the eyebrow exists to do exactly that. So the rule
 * cannot be "the transform changed the text". It is: the transform REPLACED a character instead of
 * re-casing it — the mapping does not round-trip, or produces more than one character:
 *
 *     replaces(c) := up(c) !== c  AND  ( up(c).length !== 1  OR  low(up(c)) !== c )
 *
 * Verified against the characters this product actually renders — a z A Z 0 9 $ % ≈ . , - _ /
 * space é ü Μ μ L X C are all SAFE — and against the known-lossy set: µ→Μ, ß→SS, ﬁ→FI, ŉ→ʼN,
 * ı→I, ς→Σ, ΐ→Ϊ́. 117 characters in U+0020..U+2FFF are lossy under uppercase; the rule needs no
 * list of them because it computes the answer.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ONE HOLE, STATED RATHER THAN LEFT IMPLIED: `μ` U+03BC (GREEK SMALL LETTER MU) uppercases
 * to Μ U+039C and BACK to μ, so it round-trips and this predicate calls it safe — correctly, since
 * flagging it would flag Greek prose. A µ typed as U+03BC would therefore be uppercased with no
 * offender reported. That hole is closed from the other side by a named case in caseAudit.test.tsx:
 * the product may not render U+03BC at all. Measured: it renders none today, and the two characters
 * are also silently unequal to every `getByText`, so mixing them is its own defect.
 */

/**
 * The casing utilities this product uses, and what each sets `text-transform` to.
 *
 * ⚠ TAILWIND SHIPS FOUR CASING UTILITIES AND THIS MAP HAS TWO, WHICH IS A MEASURED REFUSAL RATHER
 * THAN AN OMISSION. The first version listed all four — and Tailwind's extractor reads RAW TEXT from
 * every non-test file in the content set, of which this is one, so merely SPELLING the other two
 * compiled them into the shipped stylesheet as real rules with nothing in the product rendering
 * either. Measured against a clean worktree at `dc0bd07`: 344 → 346 emitted class names, +74 bytes.
 * That is W1.8 — the open item about a sheet carrying classes that exist only because prose mentions
 * them — so this merge would have added two instances of the defect it was not fixing.
 *
 * ⚠ WHICH IS WHY THE OTHER TWO ARE NOT NAMED ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE, NOT EVEN HERE. The second
 * attempt removed them from the map and left them in this comment, and the sheet still carried both:
 * the extractor cannot tell a class from a sentence about a class, which is W1.8's whole argument and
 * preset.ts's own opening sentence is its sharpest instance. Naming them costs nothing in a
 * `.test.tsx` file, which the content globs exclude, so THE NAMES, THE MEASUREMENT AND THE µ
 * CONSEQUENCE OF EACH LIVE IN caseAudit.test.tsx §"the casing vocabulary, both directions" — which
 * also REFUSES them: either appearing in a class list in either package fails until somebody
 * classifies it here, so narrowing this map cannot silently under-report.
 *
 * `uppercase` (129 class lists apply it) and `normal-case` (1) are spelled out because the product
 * renders both — CLASS LISTS, not occurrences of the word; the census is in caseCallSites.test.ts,
 * which also records why this sentence and the one at the top of this file used to disagree.
 *
 * ⚠ 30 → 32 AT W4.6.1 STEP 7, AND THE DELTA IS FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR RATHER THAN ACCEPTED: the
 * /earnings screen adds exactly TWO — the per-row `kind` label and the breakdown table's head row.
 * Its three region eyebrows go through `Region.tsx`, which was already one of the counted call
 * sites, so a screen made of regions moves this number by its NEW LABELS and not by its regions.
 * That is the fifth consecutive rebuild for which that has been true, which is the useful part: if
 * a future screen moves it by more than its labels, something is applying the transform by hand.
