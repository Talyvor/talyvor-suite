/**
 * A MOCK ARM THAT NEVER MATCHES IS A SETUP THAT LIES ABOUT THE STATE UNDER TEST.
 *
 * ── THE FINDING THIS EXISTS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `areas/marketing/Journey.test.tsx` mocked `fetch` with an arm for `/api/signup-open`
 * returning `{signup_open: true}`. There is no such route. `signup_open` is a FIELD on
 * `/auth/me` (apps/bff/auth.go), and `lib/signupOpen.ts#useSignupProbe` fetches `/auth/me`
 * and nothing else — so that arm was never requested, in any test, ever.
 *
 * The arm being dead is not the harm. The harm is what the OTHER arm then delivered: the
 * fixture's `/auth/me` answer carried no `signup_open` at all, and `signupStateOf` maps an
 * absent field to `unknown` — deliberately, that mapping is its own documented rule. So every
 * test in that file drove the app through the signup journey in the `unknown` state while the
 * fixture's own dead arm declared the state was `open`.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED, NOT ARGUED. `AccessLine`'s `open` branch (areas/auth/Entry.tsx) was replaced with
 * `return null` and the two files run: `Entry.test.tsx` went RED on "OPEN: says a stranger can
 * start, with no invitation", and all four of `Journey.test.tsx` stayed GREEN. The product
 * promise is guarded — by the neighbour, not by the journey. Journey could not see it, because
 * Journey was never in that state.
 *
 * ── WHY A RULE AND NOT JUST A FIXED FIXTURE ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing could have noticed. A `fetch` mock is a function; an arm that never matches has no
 * failing assertion attached to it, and a URL that no longer exists looks exactly like a URL
 * that does. The census below is the only thing in this repo that compares the two halves.
 *
 * ── THE POPULATION BOUNDARY, STATED RATHER THAN LEFT TO BE DISCOVERED ────────
 *
 * The fixture half is exactly the literals a test BRANCHES on via `url.startsWith(...)` or
 * `url.includes(...)` — the shape every `fetch` mock in this repo uses to route an answer.
 * Fixtures that dispatch some other way (an `===` on the whole input, a switch on a parsed
 * pathname) are OUTSIDE this population and this rule does not see them. That is a real limit,
 * written down here rather than implied by a passing test: if such a fixture is added, this
 * census will not grow to cover it and someone must widen the extractor deliberately.
 *
 * The route half is every `a.mux.HandleFunc("…")` in apps/bff/lens.go — the router itself, so a
 * route added or renamed tomorrow moves this rule with it and no list here can go stale.

 *  refuses (apps/bff/auth_test.go does exactly that with `/api/anything-unknown`, on the Go
