/**
 * THE HAND-ROLLED TWINS OF THE ONE COMPONENT THAT DEFINES A TEXT FIELD.
 *
 * `dc0bd07` found this shape in corners: a hand-rolled element BYTE-IDENTICAL to a design-system
 * component apart from one class. `fe36452` found it in placeholders and fixed three fields.
 * `a6e66ff` measured that those same three are ALSO missing
 * `transition-colors duration-200 hover:border-rule-strong` and `disabled:*`, and handed it over.
 *
 * ⚠ I RE-MEASURED RATHER THAN INHERITING THE THREE, AND THE POPULATION IS FIVE. The handed-over
 * count came from the `placeholder=` sweep, so it saw the three `<input>`s that carry one. The two
 * `<textarea>`s are twins of the same class list and were never in the frame:
 *
 *     IssueList.tsx      <input>     create-issue title
 *     SpaceList.tsx      <input>     create-space name
 *     SpaceView.tsx      <input>     create-page title
 *     IssueDetail.tsx    <textarea>  issue description      ← not in the handed-over three
 *     PageView.tsx       <textarea>  page body draft        ← not in the handed-over three
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE ENFORCES IS INTERACTION PARITY, NOT APPEARANCE, and the line matters. A field
 * that does not respond to hover when every design-system field does is a defect. A field painted
 * on a different plane may be an inset-on-a-card decision. The first is checked here; the second
 * is MEASURED AND REPORTED at the bottom of this docstring and deliberately not merged.
 *
 * ⚠ THE REQUIRED SET IS DERIVED FROM `Input.tsx`, NEVER LISTED HERE. A curated list guards the
 * properties somebody thought of (#91) and goes stale the moment the component gains one. Read
 * from the component, both directions: a twin missing one fails, and a required token nothing
 * requires any more fails as stale.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED, REPORTED, NOT FIXED — APPEARANCE DIVERGENCES, because each needs a design answer:
 *   · `Input.tsx` declares `bg-surface`. THE TWO TEXTAREAS DISAGREE WITH EACH OTHER —
 *     IssueDetail's is `bg-surface`, PageView's is `bg-canvas` — and all three `<input>`s are
 *     `bg-canvas`. Same control type, two planes, in one product. Whether a field inset on a card
 *     should read `canvas` is a design call, not a typo, and it is nobody's yet.
 *   · `Input.tsx` declares `h-8` (32px) and `px-2.5`; every twin uses `px-2 py-1` and no height,
 *     so a hand-rolled field is a different HEIGHT from a design-system one on the same screen.
 *   · The obvious fix for all three `<input>`s is to USE `<Input>`, which deletes the divergence
 *     rather than tracking it. That changes plane and height on three live surfaces, so it is a
 *     design decision with a screenshot attached, not a session's call.

 * THE WALK'S OWN POPULATION, ASSERTED AGAINST AN INSTRUMENT THAT DOES NOT SHARE ITS MACHINERY.

 * ⚠ MEASURED, NOT SUSPECTED (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-areasprune-census-3a6d.py`). Every rule below is
 * SILENT when the product is correct, which is byte-identical to what a walk that stopped
 * descending reports. Armed with a real hand-rolled `<input />` carrying none of Input.tsx's
 * contract, planted in a real file under `apps/web/src/areas/lens`:
 *   A1  the defect with the tree whole            → this file REDS.
 *   A2  the same defect, `areas/lens` unreachable → GREEN. 23 of the 69 production files under
 *       apps/web/src (33%) stopped being read and nothing here noticed.
 * The floor at `controls.length > 4` and the contract floor are both satisfied by the files that
 * survive, so RAISING A NUMBER IS THE WRONG REPAIR — it would be a threshold nobody measured.
 *
 * ⚠ AND NO SECOND INSTRUMENT WAS WATCHING: this file's test count is FIXED at 8, so unlike
 * `packages/ui/src/__tests__/invariant.test.ts` — which generates one `it()` per file and whose
 * 104 → 81 drop test-manifest.json catches — losing a whole product area moved nothing here.
 *
 * THE REPAIR IS #183's AND IT IS THRESHOLD-FREE. `import.meta.glob` is resolved by Vite at
 * transform time and touches `node:fs` not at all, so a wrong root, a changed extension filter or
 * a walk that stops descending cannot move both instruments the same way. Compared BOTH
 * DIRECTIONS. The floor is for the one failure that CAN move both: an anchor resolving to an
 * empty tree leaves the two enumerations agreeing on nothing.
