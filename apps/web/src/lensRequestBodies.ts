/**
 * THE SIX REQUEST BODIES THIS BFF BUILDS FOR talyvor-lens, AND THE POPULATION THEY COME OUT OF.
 *
 * This module is the shared half of two guards: `lensRequestBodyRegister.test.ts` holds every
 * body here to a `cannot` entry in `deploy/decision-expiry.sh`, and `aiRequestBodyRegister.test.ts`
 * next door subtracts this table from its own marshal census so the bodies it does NOT cover stay
 * counted rather than dropped. Both numbers used to be literals in a comment; they are derived here.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THIS FAMILY IS DIFFERENT FROM THE DOCS ONE NEXT DOOR. Every body in `aiRequestBodyRegister`
 * is a NAMED Go struct, so its keys are findable by name. These six are anonymous maps and structs
 * — `json.Marshal(map[string]int64{"usd_cents": …})` and friends — which is exactly why the sibling
 * census puts them in its `anonymous` bucket and cannot name them. An anonymous literal is not a
 * lesser claim about another repository; it is the same claim with nowhere to hang a test.
