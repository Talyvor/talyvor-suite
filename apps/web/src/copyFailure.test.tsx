/**
 * copyFailure.test.tsx — EVERY COPY BUTTON IN THE PRODUCT REPORTS SUCCESS AND ONLY SUCCESS.
 * WHEN THE COPY DOES NOT HAPPEN, NOTHING SAYS SO — AND ON THE ONE-TIME KEY CARD THE NEXT
 * CONTROL DESTROYS THE ONLY COPY OF THE CREDENTIAL.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MEASURED, IN REAL CHROME, ON THE SHIPPED ARTIFACT ───────────────────────
 *
 * `apps/web/dist` at `91d14d8` (bundle `index-cwxATUTy.js`, read out of the page's own
 * `<script src>`), served over plain HTTP from two origins by the same server, driven with
 * Playwright. The only difference between the two rows is the ORIGIN:
 *
 *     http://127.0.0.1:8791    isSecureContext true    navigator.clipboard  object
 *     http://192.168.100.149:8791  isSecureContext false    navigator.clipboard  undefined
 *
 * `navigator.clipboard` is exposed ONLY in a secure context. The loopback row is the positive
 * control: it proves the instrument can see a clipboard when the browser has one, so the
 * `undefined` in the second row is a fact about the origin and not about headless Chrome.
 *
 * On the NON-SECURE origin, with the real screens driven to their real states:
 *
 *     /keys   mint a key → "Copy key" clicked   label stays "Copy key", live region empty,
 *                                               Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties
 *                                               of undefined (reading 'writeText')
 *     /setup  5 copy buttons clicked in turn    every label unchanged, NO error raised at all
 *
 * ⚠ THE TWO CALL SITES FAIL DIFFERENTLY, AND THE ONE THAT LOOKS GUARDED IS NOT SAFER.
 * `Setup.tsx` writes `navigator.clipboard?.writeText(text).then(…)`. Optional chaining
 * short-circuits the WHOLE chain, so when `clipboard` is undefined the `.then` is never
 * evaluated and nothing throws — the button is simply inert, five times, in silence. That `?.`
 * is the only place in the repo where anyone anticipated an absent clipboard, and what it buys
 * is a quieter failure, not a handled one. `RevealOnce.tsx` has no `?.` and throws instead.
 * Neither tells the reader anything.
 *
 * ── AND IT IS NOT CONFINED TO A NON-SECURE ORIGIN ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On the SECURE loopback origin, same artifact, `writeText` replaced with one that rejects
 * `NotAllowedError: Document is not focused.` — which is what Chrome itself raises on https
 * when the tab is not focused, and what a denied `clipboard-write` permission raises:
 *
 *     baseline, real clipboard      "Copy the two lines" → "Copied"      (positive control)
 *     writeText rejects             "Copy the two lines" → "Copy the two lines"
 *                                   unhandledrejection: NotAllowedError
 *
 * So the silent path is reachable on the product's own supported https posture. Neither call
 * site has a `.catch`; the failure's whole itinerary is `window.onerror`.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A DEFECT AND NOT A PREFERENCE ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `RevealOnce`'s own doc-comment states its safety property: "The SECRET is the only body-size
 * string on the card and owns the only primary action — Copy — which copies the secret and
 * nothing else", and the card prints "Store it now — it will not be shown again." next to that
 * button. `Keys.tsx` adds: "On dismissal it leaves the DOM and the mutation cache; there is no
 * way back." The card therefore stakes an irreversible act on a control that, when it fails,
 * is indistinguishable from one that worked-and-you-missed-it — and the control immediately
 * below it is "Done — I stored it".
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A `.catch` CHECK ───────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ ASSERTING THAT A `.catch` EXISTS WOULD PASS FOR A `.catch` THAT SWALLOWS. What is asserted
 * is what the READER gets: after a copy that did not happen, the screen must say so, in text a
 * person can read. Each screen is driven in THREE clipboard environments — absent, rejecting,
 * and working — and the WORKING one is a positive control inside the sweep: a component that
 * always claimed failure would pass the first two cases and fail the third.
 *
 * ⚠ AND EVERY COUNT CARRIES A FLOOR. "no copy button lied" is also what a screen that rendered
 * no copy buttons reports. Every case asserts the button count first, so a screen that failed
 * to load reds the premise instead of reporting a clean sweep.
 *
 * ── TWO THINGS THE CONTROLS FOUND THAT READING THIS FILE WOULD NOT ───────────────────
 *
 * `apps/web/scripts/w11-copy-failure-controls.py`, 9/9 caught by the case named before the run,
 * every one with a must-stay-green companion. Two of them rewrote this file:
 *
 *   · C2 — reverting `CopyBlock` to EXACTLY the code that shipped reddened NOTHING. `/setup`
 *     renders `RevealOnce` as well as five `CopyBlock`s, and the first version of these cases
 *     asked "does the page say it": RevealOnce's one notice was answering for all six buttons,
 *     so the entire CopyBlock half was unmeasured while scoring green. Every assertion here is
 *     now a COUNT — N buttons that failed must produce N notices — and C2 catches.
 *   · A case asserting no rejection escapes to `window.onunhandledrejection` PASSED under every
 *     control, including the ones that restore the leak. jsdom does not deliver Node's rejection
 *     tracking to the window, so that listener is never called; measured with a bare
 *     `Promise.reject(…).then(…)`, which produced ZERO events. The case is gone rather than
 *     kept as decoration — see where it stood, below. The escape is real and is recorded from
 *     Chrome in the header above, which is the instrument that can see it.

       the code that DID leak one. MEASURED with a throwaway probe: a bare

       events to `window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection')`. Node's rejection tracking is
       not wired into jsdom's window, so the listener that case was built on is never called and
       the assertion is `expect([]).toEqual([])` forever.
       The escape IS measured, in the instrument that can see it: real Chrome on the shipped
       bundle logged `unhandledrejection: NotAllowedError: Document is not focused.` — the run
       recorded in this file's header. That is where that claim lives; it is not re-asserted here
