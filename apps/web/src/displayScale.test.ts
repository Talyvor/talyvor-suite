/**
 * THE MARKETING SCALE STOPS AT THE GATE — the rule preset.ts wrote about itself and never swept for.
 *
 * `preset.ts` §DISPLAY declares six type steps for the public page and then states the boundary in
 * its own words:
 *
 *     ⚠ NOT FOR THE APP. Nothing behind the AuthGate should reach for these; if a console screen
 *     ever wants display type, that is a design conversation, not an import.
 *
 * MEASURED at `c71ca9c`, with every other design guard green: no test in either package so much as
 * NAMES `text-display-1..4` or `text-lede`, and one console surface had reached for them anyway —
 *
 *     apps/web/src/areas/track/IssueDetail.tsx:154
 *       <h1 className="text-display-3 text-ink">{it.title}</h1>
 *
 * `/track/*` is routed inside `<AuthGate>` in App.tsx, so that is a hero headline in a settings
 * screen — the exact outcome the comment above was written to prevent. Measured as RENDERED, not
 * merely as written (a MutationObserver over all 45 test files, 490 tests): 25 elements carry
 * `text-display-3`, 24 of them Landing's section headings across the four test files that render
 * the marketing page, and the 25th is this `<h1>`.
 *
 * ⚠ THE SIZE IS THE POINT, AND THE CONSOLE ALREADY HAD AN ANSWER. `display-3` is
 * clamp(23px, 3.2vw, 33px) at weight 500; the console scale tops out at `title` = 24px/640, and
 * the product writes its own document-title ramp down in `areas/docs/pm.tsx`:
 * h1 → `text-title`, h2 → `text-head`, h3 → `text-body font-semibold`. So a Docs page's own H1
 * rendered at 24px while a Track issue title rendered at up to 33px — two document titles, one
 * console, two scales, and the larger one sat on a baseline row beside its `TAL-1` identifier at
 * 12px. Fixed by using the answer that was already written, not by inventing a seventh step.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS READS THE ROUTER RATHER THAN A LIST OF SURFACES ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Behind the AuthGate" is a fact about ROUTING, and App.tsx states it exactly once: a root
 * `<Routes>` whose public entries sit beside one `<AuthGate>` route, and the shell `<Routes>`
 * inside it holding every console surface. A curated list of app files would guard the surfaces
 * someone thought of and say nothing about the next one (the #91 lesson), so both sets are derived
 * — the entry components are read out of those two blocks, and each set is closed over its own
 * local imports. A new console route is swept the moment it is routed, and a shared
 * `packages/ui` component lands in BOTH closures, which is correct: anything the app renders is
 * behind the gate no matter which package it lives in.
 *
 * ⚠ A DERIVED SWEEP CANNOT SEE WHAT IS NO LONGER THERE, so it is paired with floors that can:
 * the step classification is checked against `preset.ts` in BOTH directions (a new step fails
 * until it is classified as console or marketing, a deleted one fails as stale), the gated closure
 * must still reach named files, and the public hero must still render `text-display-1` — a rule
 * about a scale nobody uses any more is a rule about nothing, and it should say so rather than
 * pass.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ AND THAT PARAGRAPH WAS TRUE OF THE WRONG SET FOR THREE MERGES. It says "the gated closure
 * must still reach named files", which reads as cover for the sweep at the bottom of this file.
 * It was not: the floor and the sweep each built their OWN closure from a different reader, so the
 * floor vouched only for itself. `7513c91` emptied the reader the SWEEP used and every instrument
 * in both packages stayed green. Measured at `298b659` — floor 67 files, sweep 0. Both now read
 * one memoised `gatedFiles()` (§THE GATED CLOSURE below) and the sweep carries its own floor as
 * well, because the lesson is not "add a floor", it is "a floor over a set nobody else reads is a
 * fact about that set". Reproduced under control (scripts/w11-display-sweep-controls.py, C1c).

 * wrote both when they meant the same thing. `7513c91` (#108) moved every console page into the
 * `CONSOLE_ROUTES` table, which empties the JSX reader — `git log -L` on the sweep line shows it
 * was never touched again — and from that merge on the sweep ran over ZERO files. MEASURED at
 * `298b659`, three merges later: the floor test's closure was 67 files and the sweep's was 0, so
 * `expect(offenders).toEqual([])` was true of every possible state of the product. The rule this
 * whole file exists to enforce was unenforced and green.
 *
 * ⚠ A FLOOR IN A NEIGHBOURING TEST CANNOT VOUCH FOR THIS SWEEP. #108 fixed the reader in the two
 * tests that named it and left the third, and every instrument stayed green because each test's
 * floor guarded only the set that test built. The structural fix is not a better floor, it is ONE
 * set: both readers are unioned here, memoised, and every consumer below reads this. The sweep also
 * keeps its OWN floor, so re-splitting the definition reds immediately rather than going quiet.
