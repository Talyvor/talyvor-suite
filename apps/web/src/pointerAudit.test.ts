/**
 * A `File.tsx:NN` POINTER IS A CLAIM ABOUT A LINE, AND NOTHING IN THIS REPO CHECKED ONE.
 *
 * This item has now paid for the same lesson three times. `47486d3` wrote it down after its own
 * first draft reported an offender at the wrong line:
 *
 *     a wrong line number in a failure message sends the next reader to the wrong place
 *
 * and then `319335c` regressed it in a different file. The pointers do not rot because anyone
 * edits them — they rot because somebody inserts a line ABOVE the thing they name. Every fix this
 * item ships moves code down, so every merge is an opportunity for silent drift, and a stale
 * pointer is invisible to every instrument here: it is prose to the type checker, prose to eslint,
 * and prose to all seven audits.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MEASURED, AND WHY THE SWEEP IS THE POINT ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `319335c` handed over TWO stale pointers, both naming `MuNumeral.tsx:19`. A census of both
 * packages at that SHA finds ELEVEN pointers, and THREE of them are stale — the third,
 * `caseAudit.ts:42`, is stale on BOTH axes and nobody had looked at it:
 *
 *     caseAudit.ts:42  "Landing.tsx:72 is `<span className="font-figure text-eyebrow uppercase
 *                       text-faint">{unit}</span>`"
 *     Landing.tsx:72    <span className="inline-flex items-baseline gap-1.5">      ← the wrapper
 *     Landing.tsx:78    <span className="font-figure text-eyebrow uppercase text-faint">
 *     Landing.tsx:79      <CaseSafe>{unit}</CaseSafe>            ← and it no longer says {unit}
 *
 * That sentence is the load-bearing argument for why the case rule cannot be a source rule, and
 * the code it quotes to prove it had already been changed BY THE FIX THAT RULE EXISTS TO DESCRIBE.
 * Fixing the two that were handed over and not sweeping for the third is this item's own recurring
 * finding — "the fix was applied where the defect was found and the same shape one directory over
 * was never swept for" — which is why this is a census and a pin rather than two edits.
 *
 * ── LIVE vs HISTORICAL IS A CLASSIFICATION, NOT AN EXEMPTION ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three of the eleven name a line as it stood at a NAMED PAST SHA (`1351de9`, `c71ca9c`) and are
 * correct as written — a reader is told they are reading history. They cannot be checked the same
 * way, and skipping them would leave a hole an author could park anything in. So they assert the
 * OPPOSITE: a HISTORICAL pointer's target must NOT contain the fragment. An entry filed as history
 * that has quietly become true again fails as MISFILED and has to be re-read, and an entry filed
 * as LIVE that drifts fails as STALE. Neither direction is a free pass.
 *
 * ── THE FLOOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The table is compared to the census as a SET, both directions. A pointer added anywhere in
 * either package is unclassified and fails; a pointer deleted leaves a stale entry and fails. A
 * source-derived guard cannot see a deletion and a pinned list cannot see an addition, so this
 * repo's answer is to hold both and require them to agree — the failure mode that keeps recurring
 * here is a sweep whose closure quietly went empty while its assertion stayed true.
 *
 * ── THE LIMIT, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A pointer is checked against ONE LINE. A sentence that names the right line while describing it
 * wrongly still passes — this pins WHERE, not WHAT. It also reads raw source including comments,
 * deliberately: a pointer inside a comment is exactly the thing being checked, so blanking
 * comments here would empty the closure entirely.
 *
 * ── AND THE WALK WAS `/\.tsx?$/`, SO THE FILES A DEPLOYER READS WERE OUTSIDE IT ──────────────
 *
 * Every claim above is about source comments, and the extension filter made that scope literal:
 * markdown was never opened. MEASURED at `6340cf8` — this repository's six `.md` files carry FIVE
 * in-repo pointers and FOUR ARE STALE:
 *
 *     deploy/README.md:385             "REFUSES TO START if this is set"   apps/bff/main.go:112 → `}`
 *     deploy/FULL-STACK-DEPLOY.md:39   "BFF requires LENS_PROVISION_SECRET"          main.go:94  → a comment line
 *     deploy/FULL-STACK-DEPLOY.md:40   "refuses to boot if LENS_API_KEY is set"      main.go:96  → docsGatewaySecret
 *     areas/docs/BFF-GAPS.md:14        "same as the existing route"       apps/bff/lens.go:74    → /api/bonds
 *
 * TWO of the four are rows of a table whose own header is "Verified from source, with the file and
 * line so you can re-check rather than trust this table" — the column exists so a reader does not
 * have to trust the table, and following those two lands on a comment line and an unrelated struct
 * field. The third is the env-table row telling an operator that `TRACK_WORKSPACE_ID` now stops the
 * boot, cited at a closing brace. The fourth is an area note's account of the Docs proxy.
 *
 * The fifth (`apps/bff/auth.go:14-15`, a note that stale prose still sits there) is CORRECT, so
 * the rot is not universal and the pins are not a formality. None of the four rotted by anyone
 * editing them: main.go's refusals moved ~20 lines down when the config struct grew comments, and
 * lens.go:74 was the ONE Docs route before three more were mounted above it.
 *
 * ⚠ THE POPULATION IS EVERY `.md` IN THE REPOSITORY, not the two package roots — a guard scoped
 * to where the defect was found is how this item keeps re-finding the same shape one directory
 * over. Both enumerations are widened together and still compared both directions.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ONE FORM STILL OUT OF SCOPE, SAID OUT LOUD: `IN_REPO_GO` requires a repo-relative
 * `apps/…` path, so FULL-STACK-DEPLOY.md's two `old main.go:89` / `:92` pointers — deliberately
 * historical, naming a PRE-#30 binary — are skipped as unresolvable rather than swept in. A bare
 * `main.go` names three repositories' main.go and this file cannot tell which; that is the same
 * cross-repo boundary `upstreamCitations.test.ts` refuses to guess at.

 *
 * ⚠ `.go` WAS MISSING AND THE OMISSION HAD ALREADY COST SOMETHING. `upstreamCitations.test.ts`
 * bans line citations into talyvor-track because the premise lives in another repo and cannot be
 * checked from here; it says in the same breath that `apps/bff/lens.go:415` and
 * `apps/bff/billing.go:180` "name a file IN THIS REPOSITORY … verifiable from here — a guard
 * could actually check them". None did. MEASURED at `eb051cd`: of the three such citations,
 * `checkoutRefusalSurface.test.tsx`'s `apps/bff/billing.go:180` was written at `31095b7` when 180
 * WAS the first line of handleLXCCheckout's doc — "Nothing is charged here … payment happens at
 * Stripe" — and a later commit IN THIS REPOSITORY moved that comment to 200-203. Line 180 is now
 * inside `probeBillingEnabled`, the function whose whole documented purpose is that it can never
 * start a purchase. So a sentence explaining why "nothing was charged" is honest points a reader
 * at the one path that is not the charge, and nothing went red.
 *
 * The same sentence cites `TopUp.tsx:24` in the SAME PARENTHESIS, and that one has been pinned

 * ⚠ THE POPULATION IS ASSERTED, BECAUSE A COMPLETE WALK IS NOT A GUARANTEED ONE. Measured at

 * `~/talyvor-queue/w11-population-census-4b2e.py` — this file reads 102 of the 102 production
 * files under its two roots, tests on top. Its population is WHOLE today. Nothing here said so,
 * and nothing here would have noticed it stop being whole: with the walk made to skip
 * `areas/docs` and nothing else changed, this file stayed GREEN
 * (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-stoppedwalk-controls-4b2e.py`, where all five sweeps in this class were
 * green on the same mutation).
 *
 * ⚠ AND FOR THIS FILE A LOST SUBTREE IS NOT A MISSED CITATION — IT IS A CITATION THAT BECOMES
 * UNVERIFIABLE AND IS NOT SAID TO BE. The rule reads `File.tsx:123` markers and checks the line
 * they point AT. A walk that stops descending removes the TARGETS, so every pin into the lost
 * subtree simply stops being examined; the pins stay in the file reading as though something
 * still checks them. That is the failure mode this repo has named repeatedly — a guard that is
 * green because it can no longer be red.
 *
 * `import.meta.glob` is resolved by Vite at TRANSFORM time and touches `node:fs` not at all, so a
 * wrong root, a changed extension filter or a walk that stops descending cannot move both
 * enumerations the same way. Compared BOTH DIRECTIONS.
 *
 * ⚠ THE CALL IS LITERAL ON PURPOSE. Vite rewrites `import.meta.glob` by matching the SYNTAX at
 * transform time; hoisting the patterns into a variable typechecks and then dies at runtime.
 * ⚠ `SELF` IS SUBTRACTED FROM BOTH SIDES AND FOR TWO DIFFERENT REASONS THAT HAPPEN TO AGREE:
 * the walk drops it deliberately (a file citing itself is not a cross-file pin), and Vite never
 * returns the module that CONTAINS the glob call at all. The rule below that asserts the walk
 * excludes SELF is the one that keeps the first reason honest.
