/**
 * THE FOCUS AUDIT — the accent is the product's focus signal, and it must be the ONLY one.
 *
 * packages/ui/src/lib/focus.ts writes the rule down and hands enforcement to nobody:
 *
 *     The quality-floor focus ring: a 2px accent outline at 2px offset, only on
 *     keyboard focus (focus-visible). Applied to every interactive element.
 *
 * "Applied to every interactive element" is a claim about the PRODUCT made in a file that can
 * only describe a STRING. Six design-system components import it. Nine hand-rolled controls did
 * not, and nothing anywhere was red — the #93/#97/#99 shape a fourth time: the file that states
 * the rule is the one file that cannot enforce it.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT COSTS, MEASURED IN A REAL ENGINE RATHER THAN REASONED ABOUT ──────────────────────
 *
 * Chrome 151, the real built stylesheet, each control given keyboard focus and its COMPUTED
 * outline read (`:focus-visible` confirmed matching in every row):
 *
 *     system ring        solid 2px  rgb(58,214,192)   offset 2px   ← --accent, dark theme
 *     hand-rolled Row    solid 1px  rgb(58,214,192)   offset 0     ← right hue, half the width
 *     bare control       auto  1px  rgb(153,200,255)  offset 0     ← CHROME'S BLUE
 *
 * and in the light theme the bare control is `rgb(0,95,204)`, against the light theme's `accent`.
 * Measured identically for textarea, text input, select, range and button.
 *
 * So this is not "a missing nicety". A design language whose stated premise is ONE electric
 * accent painted the BROWSER'S BLUE on nine controls, in both themes — a second focus hue in a
 * system that declares one, on exactly the surfaces a keyboard user moves through. The controls
 * are not invisible (measured: zero elements carry `outline-none` without a replacement, so
 * nothing was made unfocusable); they are wearing a colour that is not in the palette.
 *
 * ── WHY IT READS THE DOM AND NOT THE SOURCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `Button` accepts `asChild` and renders through Radix `Slot`, which MERGES its className onto
 * its child — thirteen call sites do `<Button asChild><Link …/></Button>`. The resulting <a>
 * carries the full ring while the source element that produced it (`<Link to=…>`) has no
 * className at all. A rule that read class attributes would report every one of those anchors as
 * unringed and would have to grow an exemption for the component it is supposed to be checking.
 * The class and the element meet in the DOM and nowhere else — the same argument caseAudit.ts
 * makes for an inherited `text-transform`.
 *
 * ── THE EXEMPTION, NARROW AND PINNED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An UNDERLINED <a> is a link in a run of prose, not a control, and the UA ring on it is a
 * deliberate recorded choice rather than an oversight: measured, 76 of the 184 focusable
 * elements this suite renders are underlined text links, and giving all 76 a 2px offset outline
 * is a design conversation about how prose looks, not a defect being fixed. focus.ts's sentence
 * has been corrected to say what is actually covered, because a comment that overstates its
 * reach is the thing this repo keeps catching.
 *
 * ⚠ THE EXEMPTION IS A SHAPE, NOT A TAG. An <a> that is NOT underlined is a link wearing
 * control clothing — a tile, a card, a button-shaped thing — and it is NOT exempt. That is the
 * half that keeps the carve-out from quietly widening into "anchors do not need focus rings".
 */

/**
 * The system ring, spelled out.
 *
 * ⚠ THESE ARE LITERALS AND NOT AN IMPORT OF `focusRing`, DELIBERATELY. A guard that reads the
 * constant it is checking compares the constant to itself and passes for every value it could
 * ever hold. focusAudit.test.tsx parses `focus.ts` and requires this list to match it token for
 * token, both directions — so changing the ring in one place and not the other is red, and the
 * two can only agree by actually agreeing.
 *
 * ⚠ SPELLING THEM HERE SHIPS NO NEW CSS: all five already reach the sheet from focus.ts, which
 * is in the same content set. Measured before and after — the emitted class set is unchanged.
