/**
 * THE NUMERIC-FIELD AUDIT — the one numeral in this product that lives in a PROPERTY.
 *
 * `figureAudit.ts` reads an element's OWN TEXT: `ownText()` joins its direct TEXT NODES. That is
 * the right unit for everything the product prints, and it is structurally blind to a value the
 * user TYPES, because an `<input>` has no children at all. The same is true of the other six DOM
 * audits — case, focus, glyph, placeholder, plane, eyebrow all reach the DOM through text nodes or
 * attributes, and `value` on a controlled React input is neither: React assigns the PROPERTY.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MEASURED, AND ON WHAT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A throwaway probe was installed into `test-setup.ts` at `732cf32` and recorded every
 * `input`/`textarea`/`select` this suite renders, together with its `value` and
 * `onFigureFace(el)`. 87 distinct field records over the whole apps/web suite. NINE held a value
 * that `figureKind()` calls a figure and nothing else, and they are TWO sites:
 *
 *     <input type="text" inputmode="decimal" aria-label="LXC to receive">   "1" "1.5" "0.01" "2"
 *         ConvertLens.tsx:326 — audited by Convert.test.tsx and Held.test.tsx.  onFace=FALSE
 *     <input type="range" aria-label="Contributors in the pool">             "1"
 *         /marketing's pool slider, removed by B28.2 — it painted NO TEXT, so its value was never on screen.
 *
 * Everything else the suite types is prose: issue titles, comment bodies, space names, key names,
 * and the `tlv_ws_…` string Members asks you to retype to confirm a destructive action.
 *
 * ⚠ SO THE DEFECT IS ONE FIELD, AND IT IS THE ONE YOU READ IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SPENDING. Convert
 * turns earned LENS into LXC and Lens has no path back — the surface says so itself. Every other
 * figure on that card is on the face: the rate and the minimum (`0292cf0` put them there), and the
 * `Costs <MuNumeral>` line one row below the field. The amount you type — the number the
 * irreversible decision is ABOUT — is the body sans.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED IN A REAL ENGINE, not reasoned about (Chrome 151, the SHIPPED stylesheet
 * `dist/assets/index-*.css`, computed style on the exact markup `Input.tsx` emits):
 *
 *     ConvertLens's field as it ships   "Space Grotesk", ui-sans-serif, …   font-feature-settings: normal
 *     `font-figure` on an ANCESTOR      "IBM Plex Mono", ui-monospace, …    font-feature-settings: "tnum"
 *     `font-figure` on the ELEMENT      "IBM Plex Mono", ui-monospace, …    font-feature-settings: "tnum"
 *
 * ⚠ THAT MIDDLE ROW IS WHY THIS AUDIT REUSES `onFigureFace` RATHER THAN COPYING placeholderAudit.
 * The two rules look alike and their inheritance answers are OPPOSITE, for reasons that are facts
 * about CSS rather than choices:
 *
 *   · `placeholder:text-faint` compiles to `.placeholder\:text-faint::placeholder{…}`, which
 *     matches nothing but that element's own pseudo-element — so placeholderAudit MUST read the
 *     element's own class, and walking up would report a green the browser does not paint.
 *   · A field's VALUE is painted with `font-family`, and Tailwind's preflight sets
 *     `button,input,optgroup,select,textarea{font-family:inherit;font-feature-settings:inherit;…}`
 *     — read out of the shipped sheet, not assumed — so an ancestor's `font-figure` DOES reach it,
 *     tnum included. The walk-up is correct here and pinned by the fixture above.
 *
 * `.text-body` sets `font-size`/`line-height`/`font-weight` and NO family, so the class the field
 * already carries is not what puts it in the sans: it inherits `body{font-family:var(--sans)}`.
 *
 * ── THE PREDICATE IS THE DECLARATION, NOT THE VALUE, AND THAT IS TRAP TWO'S OWN ARGUMENT ─────
 *
 * The obvious rule is figureAudit's: is what is IN the field a figure and nothing else. Measured
 * above, that rule and this one agree on this tree — so it would cost nothing today. It is still
 * the wrong rule, for the reason figureAudit already gives about prose:
 *
 *     A user who types `42` as an ISSUE TITLE has not rendered a figure. The PRODUCT did not put a
 *     numeral alone in that box; a person did, and next time they will type "Ship the trial".
 *
 * figureAudit polices an element whose own text is a figure because the PRODUCT chose to put it
 * there. A field's contents are not the product's choice, so the product's declaration is what
 * this reads: `type="number"`, or an `inputMode` of `numeric`/`decimal`. That is a promise the
 * source makes about what the box is FOR, and it is the promise ConvertLens already makes.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS READ FROM THE DOM, not from the source, for the reason focusAudit and
 * placeholderAudit both give: `ConvertLens.tsx:326` writes `inputMode` on `<Input>`, a component
 * in ANOTHER PACKAGE that spreads it onto the real `<input>` — so the declaration and the class
 * list are written in two files, and the DOM is where they meet.
 *
 * ⚠ TWO INPUT TYPES ARE EXEMPT AND THE REASON IS THAT THEY PAINT NO TEXT. `range` is a slider and
 * `hidden` is not rendered; demanding a typeface for a numeral nobody can see is a rule that would
 * be satisfied by a class with no effect.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ AND THE EXEMPTION IS DEFENSIVE RATHER THAN LIVE — A CONTROL CORRECTED THIS SENTENCE. It first
 * said "Landing's contributor slider is the live instance". It is not. That slider declares NO
 * `inputMode`, so it never reaches `PAINTS_NO_TEXT` at all: it is excluded one line lower, by not
 * declaring itself numeric. MEASURED — C3 deletes the exemption line and the slider's unit case
 * stays GREEN; the only case that reds is `hidden`, a different entry. The set is reached only by
 * a field that declares BOTH (`type="range" inputmode="decimal"`), which nothing in this product
 * does. Both entries stay, because the day something does declare both the rule should already be
 * right — but the test that pins them now says which one is doing the work, and the sentence no
 * longer claims a live instance it does not have.
 *
 * What IS live and IS measured is the slider itself: its value is a figure, it is not on the face,
 * and that is correct. That is a fact about the census, not about this set.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH, MEASURED RATHER THAN REASONED ABOUT ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * A numeric field that declares NOTHING — `type="text"` with no `inputMode` — is invisible to this
 * rule, and there is no instrument in this repo that would see it. Today there are none: the probe
 * above found exactly one text field holding a figure and it is the declared one. That is a
 * measurement of this tree, not a property of the rule, and whoever adds the second numeric field
 * should declare it — which they want to do anyway, since `inputMode` is what gives a phone the
 * number pad.

import { onFigureFace } from './figureAudit'

/**
 * Input types that paint no text, so no typeface applies. See the exemption note above.
 * ⚠ `range` was not hypothetical: /marketing rendered one until B28.2, and its value was a figure.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ `hidden` IS SPELLED IN TWO PIECES AND THAT IS NOT AN AFFECTATION — IT IS A DEFECT THIS FILE
 * SHIPPED AND THEN MEASURED ON ITSELF. `hidden` is also a Tailwind utility, and Tailwind's
 * extractor reads RAW TEXT: written plainly, this line compiled `.hidden{display:none}` into the
 * production stylesheet for an element that does not exist. Measured on the built artifact —
 * `dist/assets/index-*.css` went 22,420 → 22,441 bytes and 308 → 309 class names, and the diff of
 * the emitted name sets was exactly one entry, `hidden`.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE GUARD THAT EXISTS FOR THIS FAILURE CANNOT SEE IT, which is the transferable part.
 * `proseClasses.test.ts` catches a class supplied by a SENTENCE, by generating the sheet twice and
 * diffing raw against comment-stripped. This one came from a STRING LITERAL in ordinary source —
 * which `stripComments` deliberately PROTECTS, because a string literal is where real class lists
 * live (`className="text-body text-ink"`). So both generations contain it, the diff is empty and
 * the guard is green. That hole is real, it is now non-empty for the first time, and it is NOT
 * closed here: telling a class list from a data string is the same problem deadClasses.test.ts's
 * rule B already wrestles with, and guessing at it on a stylesheet is not a session's call.
 *
 * MEASURED, all four through the real generator over a raw source string:
 *     new Set(['range', 'hidden'])              emits ["hidden"]   ← what this line was
 *     /^(range|hidden)$/                        emits ["hidden"]
 *     'range hidden'.split(' ')                 emits ["hidden"]
 *     new Set(['range', `hid${'den'}`])         emits []           ← what it is
 * The plain form is kept above as the control: it is what proves the other three are not passing
 * because the probe read nothing.
