// Entry.tsx — the two front doors: /signup for a stranger, /signin for someone coming back.
//
// ONE MECHANISM, TWO PAGES. Both actions go to /auth/login; the OIDC round-trip does not care
// which page you started on, and there is no "create account" API to call — the callback
// provisions a Lens workspace and bootstraps a Track one for any identity it has not seen
// before. So the difference between signing up and signing in is entirely a difference in what
// the reader needs to be told, which is exactly why it must not be one page:
//
//   A STRANGER needs to know what this is, that they may start, what happens when they click,
//   and what they will be holding afterwards. Everything before "Continue" is them deciding
//   whether to trust a redirect to a third party.
//
//   A RETURNING PERSON needs the shortest path back. Explaining the product is noise, and
//   "create your workspace" is wrong — they have one, with a balance and a ledger in it.
//
// WHAT THIS PAGE REFUSES TO SAY, and why:
//
//   "Your organisation's identity provider" — the old card's wording, and the reason this page
//   exists. It is correct for an enterprise SSO rollout and disastrous for someone arriving
//   from the internet: it tells them they need a company account and an IT department, when in
//   fact they need a Google login. Nobody complains about this; they leave.
//
//   The IdP's NAME. The deployment's issuer is configuration (OIDC_ISSUER) — Google for the
//   hosted trial, but Keycloak, Authentik, Dex or anything else for a self-hoster. "Continue
//   with Google" is a claim the bundle cannot check, and a self-hoster's users would read a
//   brand that has nothing to do with their login. So the copy describes the MECHANISM, which
//   is true of every issuer: an account you already have, and no new password.
//
//   Anything about who may enter — unless the server said. See lib/signupOpen.ts.
