// Entry.test.tsx — THE TWO FRONT DOORS.
//
// Sign up and sign in are ONE mechanism (the same OIDC round-trip at /auth/login) and must not
// be one page. The person reading them wants opposite reassurances:
//
//   A STRANGER needs to know what this is, that they can start, and what they will have when
//   they finish. They have never heard of us; "You'll be sent to your organisation's identity
//   provider" tells them they need a company account, which is the single most effective way to
//   turn away someone who could have signed up in twenty seconds.
//
//   A RETURNING PERSON needs the shortest path back in. Explaining the product to them is
//   noise, and "create your workspace" is actively wrong — they have one.
//
// So: two pages, two sets of words, one destination. These tests assert the WORDS, because the
// words are the entire feature — the mechanism underneath was already built and already works.
//
// And they assert them against what the server says about the door (signup_open), never against
// a literal in the bundle. A page that hardcodes "closed trial, accounts set up by hand" keeps
// saying it after the trial opens, and a page that hardcodes "get started free" says it while
// the gate is still six addresses. Both are one deploy away at all times.
//
// ⚠ APOSTROPHES. The copy on these pages uses typographic ’ and a straight ' in a regex does
// NOT match it. The enterprise-SSO assertion below was written with `organisation'?s` and was
// VACUOUS: pasting the exact banned sentence back onto the page left the suite green. It was
// caught only by deliberately re-introducing the sentence and watching for a failure that never
// came. Every apostrophe in an assertion here is therefore a character class, and any new one
// must be positive-controlled the same way before it is believed.
