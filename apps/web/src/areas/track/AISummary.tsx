// AISummary — Track's AI thread summary, and the FIRST browser control for any Track AI feature.
//
// ⚠ WHAT W1.7 RECORDED, TWICE, FROM TWO INDEPENDENT SESSIONS: "Track's AI ENTIRELY" is
// unreachable — the frontend never calls these endpoints and does not consume `ai_available` at
// all. Track ships five AI features (triage, find-duplicates, thread summary, sprint suggestion,
// semantic search) and every one of them was reachable only by curl. This is the first one that
// is not, and it is the only one of the five that is a plain read: triage can overwrite priority
// and labels, two are POSTs, and semantic search belongs to the list screen.
//
// ⚠ IT IS A BUTTON, NOT A PAGE LOAD, BECAUSE IT COSTS. A summary that actually runs is a metered
// Lens call attributed to THIS issue — `SummarizeThread` passes `issue.Identifier` as the feature
// id and Track's syncer resolves a row with no issue header by `identifier = lens_feature`
// (internal/issue/store.go RecordRequestSpendAttributed), so the money lands on
// `issues.ai_cost_usd`, the number the Details card above renders. ⚠ THIS HEADER ALREADY NAMED
// THE SYNCER while the card below it printed "what it costs is added to the AI cost above" — the
// timing was wrong on screen and right here. See meteredCallCopy. Fetching on mount would spend
// on every ticket anyone opened. Track caches for an hour, so a second press inside the hour is
// free — and this screen cannot tell a cached answer from a fresh one, so it does not claim to.
//
// ⚠⚠ THE STATE THIS SCREEN IS CAREFUL ABOUT — MEASURED, NOT READ. tab-9e42 ran talyvor-track's
// engine at `eb0b39b` with a Lens URL and NO mint credential (i.e. AI configured nowhere) and
// drove SummarizeThread at 0, 1, 9 and 10 comments. `SummarizeThread` checks the COMMENT COUNT
// FIRST, so 0/1/9 all answered `{"min_comments":10,"summary_available":false}` and only 10 reached
// the availability check and answered `{"ai_available":false,…}`. The too-short reply is therefore
// IDENTICAL on a deployment with a working AI and on one where AI has never run — and since most
// issues have fewer than ten comments, it is what almost every ticket returns on a box like this
// one. Rendering it as "add ten comments and you'll get a summary" would be a promise this app
// cannot keep, which is precisely what W1.7 asked not to ship ("must say so plainly rather than
// offering a button that 502s"). So the too-short arm says what Track's rule is and says, in one
// clause, that this answer does not report on AI at all.
//
// ⚠ AND TRACK AND DOCS SIGNAL "AI IS OFF" DIFFERENTLY, so the shared classifier cannot be reused
// here. Docs sends 503 + `code:"AI_UNAVAILABLE"` (lib/productState.ts#isAIUnavailable); Track
// sends 200 + `ai_available:false` in the BODY. One is an error the query layer throws, the other
// is a successful read — no predicate over `err` can see Track's. That is why the discrimination
// lives in readSummary and not beside isAIUnavailable.

  // arriving at another issue changes `issueId` underneath this component without remounting it.
  // Without this reset, a summary requested on issue A would still be showing over issue B's
  // title, attributed to B, and the reader has no way to tell. Resetting during render lands
  // before the browser paints, so A's words are never drawn under B's heading.

    // button once and then letting an hour pass with this screen open — a laptop that slept —
    // issued `/api/track/issues/{id}/summary` a SECOND time the moment the network came back,
    // with no press. `staleTime` below is what bounds it to an hour rather than preventing it:
    // once the answer is stale a reconnect refetches, and Track's own hour-long cache has
    // expired too, so the second call is a real charge on the issue. The three options are
