// ⚠ FIVE TESTS FOR `filterIssues` STOOD HERE, AND THE FUNCTION THEY EXERCISED WAS NEVER CALLED BY
// THE PRODUCT. They are deleted with it (#173): the live list forwards every control to the BFF
// and filters nothing client-side, so a mirror of Track's WHERE clauses had no caller and no
// second opinion — its own docstring called `updated_at DESC` "the server's default listing
// order" while the server defaults to created_at, and five green tests could not see that,
// because they compared the function to itself.
//
// NOTE WHERE THIS SAMPLE DATA LIVES: here, in the test, not in a fixtures.ts that screens render
// from. That distinction is the whole lesson of the change that created this file. Rows a test
// declares are inputs to an assertion; rows a module exports become numbers on someone's screen.
