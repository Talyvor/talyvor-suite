// THE ISSUE LIST. It used to render fourteen FABRICATED issues — plausible titles, assignees, AI
// costs — behind a filter rail that could never query anything, all marked with a fixture badge.
// That was deleted, and this screen became a probe card: it asked /api/track/issues and reported
// whether the upstream answered, which told a tester the wiring was alive and gave them nothing to do.
//
// Now it is the real thing, and the rule from that deletion still holds: NOTHING HERE IS INVENTED.
// An empty tracker renders an empty state because the API returned [], not because a fixture said so.
// A brand-new workspace showing "No issues yet" is the CORRECT output, not a gap to paper over.
//
// Scope was deliberately small — list, create, change status. Detail (#83) added description,
// priority, assignee and comments, so the LOOP is complete: you can file, describe, assign,
// prioritise, discuss and close.
//
// WHAT THIS ADDS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A NEW SCREEN. The loop being complete is not the same as
// being able to run your work here. What breaks first is this list: it asked for
// `/api/track/issues` with NO query at all, so it rendered every issue ever created — closed work
// included, in whatever order the store returned, unbounded. That is fine on day one with four
// issues and unusable by week three, and no new screen fixes it.
//
// Meanwhile the BFF already validates and forwards a full contract —
// status, team_id, project_id, cycle_id, assignee_id, priority, order_by, order_dir, limit,
// offset — refusing unknown keys, and refusing `labels` outright because upstream would silently
// ignore it. The UI sent none of it. So every control below maps 1:1 onto a parameter the BFF
// already checks; nothing here filters client-side, because a control that narrowed only the rows
// already fetched would be a filter that lies about what it searched.
//
// WHOSE ISSUES: the BFF resolves the workspace from the SESSION, so this screen never names one.
// That claim is asserted in the BFF suite against the upstream path, not here — a form posting to
// the wrong tenant would look identical on this screen.

/** How many rows one page asks for. Track's own List has no COUNT, so the BFF cannot honestly
 *  offer "N of M" — see its comment. A page size plus an explicit "there may be more" is the

 * looked like a fourth free option. It is not an ordering this product can deliver.
 *
 * MEASURED, real Chrome on the built bundle, against the real `issues` DDL in a real Postgres
 * running the ORDER BY talyvor-track's own store builds (internal/issue/store.go#Store.List).
 * The control read "Priority" and the screen read, top to bottom:
 *
 *     Low — rename a variable             priority 4
 *     Medium — tidy the settings copy     priority 3
 *     High — customer data export fails   priority 2
 *     Urgent — production is down         priority 1   ← FOURTH of five
 *     None — unprioritised note           priority 0
 *
 * ⚠ THE OTHER DIRECTION IS NOT THE FIX. model.IssuePriority (upstream `model.go`, `type IssuePriority`) is
 * 0 None · 1 Urgent · 2 High · 3 Medium · 4 Low, so 0 means UNSET and sits inside the scale:
 * `desc` buries Urgent under everything, `asc` puts the unprioritised rows ABOVE it. Neither
 * numeric direction is an importance order, which is why this is not a one-character fix and
 * why the enum premise is pinned as a test that says so when it expires.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE PAGE MAKES IT UNREACHABLE, NOT MERELY MISORDERED. This screen fetches ONE page of
 * PAGE rows and has no offset control. Measured against the priority distribution tab-8e26
 * read off a real Jira export (3,020 issues: high 1023 · none 816 · medium 624 · urgent 316 ·
 * low 241), the first 50 rows are 50 × Low under `desc` and 50 × None under `asc`, and the
 * first urgent row is number 1,889 or 817 of 3,020. In either direction the sort labelled
 * "Priority" cannot put an urgent issue on the only page it fetches.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT WOULD BRING IT BACK, so this is a handover and not just a deletion: an upstream
 * ordering that ranks importance — a rank expression that sorts 0 LAST (`CASE WHEN priority=0
 * THEN 5 ELSE priority END ASC`), or a renumbered enum. That is talyvor-track's to make; the
 * expiry test in IssueList.test.tsx fails the day the enum becomes monotone and says to
 * restore this option. The same screen already refuses to offer an "open issues" status for
 * exactly this reason — a control that cannot honestly be delivered is not offered.

                `isPending` on the select, and the `.mutate()` in `onChange`), so a refused status
                change produced ZERO characters of change on the page — MEASURED at 401, 500 and 403
                alike, against a stateful fake where an accepted write moves the row to "Done".

                The reader's only signal was the select bouncing back to the value Track still holds,
                which reads as a glitch rather than a refusal. And no bar covers for it: the bar
                derives from the QUERY cache, the reads here are cached and good, and the shipped
                client sets `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` — so nothing refetches, no query error
                exists, and the bar is absent. Measured false on all three.

                ⚠ ONE SENTENCE FOR THE LIST, not one per row: the mutation is shared, only one change
                is in flight (the selects disable while pending), and a per-row sentence would move
                the table's layout under the reader's cursor.

                ⚠ NO UPSTREAM-SENTENCE BRANCH, unlike `create` above, and that is deliberate rather
                than an omission: the reader picked from a closed list this screen rendered, so a
                server sentence about the request is not about anything they could have got wrong.
