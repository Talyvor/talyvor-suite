/**
 * Track's reconciled per-issue AI cost (model.Issue.ai_cost_usd, a float USD — Track's one
 * non-µ money field; it is a rollup Lens reconciles in, not a ledger amount). Not a MuNumeral:
 * USD has no token tick.
 *
 * Money the way the ledger holds it — never rounded up into a friendlier number. A single AI
 * call is usually sub-cent, and `$0.00` on this field reads as "this issue cost nothing", which
 * is the one thing the number exists to disprove; a genuine zero says so in words instead.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS THE SHIPPED RULE, MOVED — not a new one. It was `costLabel`, a local helper in
 * IssueDetail.tsx, while this module exported a `formatUSD` that rounded to cents and had ZERO
 * production call sites. The two disagreed on every value below half a cent ($0.00 vs $0.0004)
 * and at zero, and the exported, documented, tested one was the one a developer would find.
 * The rendered output is unchanged; the dead namesake is gone. formatterReach.test.ts is the
 * guard that makes "exported but nothing calls it" fail rather than sit in a comment.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE ZERO NEEDED `tokens` TO BE TRUE, BECAUSE ZERO COST IS NOT ZERO USAGE. A response
 * served from the cache, or by a registered inference node, is written upstream with cost_usd = 0
 * and its token counts intact — talyvor-lens writes that zero as a literal in the SQL
 * (`insertCacheServeSQL`), Lens returns the row on /v1/api/spend/by-request, and talyvor-track's
 * syncer lands every row it receives with no zero-cost filter anywhere on the chain. An issue
 * whose work was pooled therefore holds `ai_tokens > 0` against `ai_cost_usd == 0`, and it is the
 * ordinary shape of a pooled issue rather than an edge case. Saying "No AI spend recorded" about
 * that issue is false, and the screen said it directly beside the token count that disproved it.
 *
 * Both strings are claims about the LEDGER and neither characterises the world: this function is
 * not told whether the zero came from a cache hit, a node serve or a reconciliation, so it
 * reports what was recorded and stops there. "Free" would be the wrong word and upstream says so
 * in its own source — "A spend view must never render this row as 'the request was free'"
 * (alerts.go), "render cache rows as 'served from cache', not 'free'" (server.go) — and Track
 * does not carry `serve_source`, so this module cannot honestly say which it was. WHAT THE ROW
 * SHOULD CALL A ZERO-COST SERVE, IF ANYTHING BEYOND THE AMOUNT, IS A PRODUCT DECISION AND IS NOT
 * MADE HERE. Only the false sentence is removed.
 *
 * `tokens` disambiguates the ZERO alone — every nonzero cost renders identically with or without
 * it — so the default keeps any caller that has no token count truthful for the case it can see.

/**
 * The sentence every metered Track AI card prints beside its button — ONE string, because three

 *
 * ── WHAT THEY USED TO SAY, AND WHY IT WAS FALSE ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * "It is a metered AI call, and what it costs is added to the AI cost above — for this issue."
 * Present tense, offered as a consequence of the click, on the three cards that sit directly
 * under the AI cost row: AISummary, FindDuplicates, TriageIssue.
 *
 * MEASURED READ-ONLY IN talyvor-track AT `882c94d2a9a71dadc59753e3bde37aac86fb1b21`: nothing on
 * the AI request path writes that number. `issues.ai_cost_usd` has exactly TWO writers in the
 * whole repository —
 *
 *   · `issue.Store.RecordSpendEvent`  — called from ONE place, the Lens `spend_alert` webhook
 *                                        (`lensintegration/webhook.go#handleSpendAlert`), which is
 *                                        asynchronous and explicitly best-effort ("a failure in one
 *                                        doesn't roll back the others").
 *   · `issue.Store.RecordRequestSpend` — called from ONE place, `Syncer.SyncFeatureSpend`, a poller
 *                                        (`cmd/track/main.go:253` → `StartSync(ctx, 15*time.Minute)`).
 *
 * and `internal/ai/` writes no spend at all. So at the moment the answer arrives the figure above
 * has NOT moved, and no refetch this app could make would find it moved either.
 *
 * ⚠ WHICH IS WHY THE FIX IS NOT `invalidateQueries`. The obvious repair — refetch the issue when
 * the mutation succeeds — reads as diligence and is worse than nothing: it spends a request to
 * re-read a number that cannot have changed yet, and leaves the reader watching a refreshed panel
 * report the old figure. A refresh that cannot observe the change is not a refresh, for the same
 * reason a guard that cannot fail is not a guard. The claim is what was wrong, so the claim is
 * what changed.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT NAMES NO INTERVAL, DELIBERATELY. "About fifteen minutes" is a true sentence in the
 * bundle that goes false the day someone passes StartSync a different duration — the exact failure
 * lib/productState.ts exists about. "When Lens reports the spend" is true on both paths and on any
 * interval, and the measured numbers live in this comment, where a reader can go and check them.
 *
 * The attribution half of the old sentence was never in doubt and is kept: the engine passes the
 * issue's own identifier as the Lens feature tag on all three of these features
 * (`internal/ai/engine.go`, the triage / duplicates / summarize call sites), so the charge really
 * does belong to this issue. What was false was WHEN the reader would see it.
