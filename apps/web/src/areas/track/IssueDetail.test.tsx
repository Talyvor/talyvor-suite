// screen printed "No comments yet. Add the first one below." — the same sentence a genuinely empty
// thread gets — on 500, on 403 and on 401 alike. Measured on the real component with only the
// comments route refused: the panel's whole text was
// "CommentsNo comments yet. Add the first one below.Add a commentComment" at all three codes.
//
// ⚠ WHY THAT IS WORSE HERE THAN ON A LIST. Every other list in this product already separates the
// two, and two of them say why in their own source: "A fault must not read as an empty tracker:
// those are different states and conflating them tells a tester their work vanished"
// (IssueList.tsx) and "This is a fault, not an empty space" (SpaceView.tsx). The comment thread is
// the one place the reader is invited to WRITE in response to what they were shown — an invitation
// to add the first comment, printed over a thread the screen could not read, asks someone to
// re-post a reply that may already be there, or to conclude a colleague never answered.
//
// ⚠ THE 401 ARM IS SEPARATE ON PURPOSE. `sessionExpiredCopy` is said ONCE at the top of the app,
// so a panel that cannot read for want of a credential says "Unavailable." and nothing more —
// the house rule IssueList and SpaceView already follow.

// React Router matches /track/issues/:id to ONE <Route> element, so moving from issue A to issue B
// changes the params underneath this component and does NOT remount it — every useState survives.
// This is the Track half of the shape `f4c1e97` (#190) fixed in areas/docs; the two screens were
// written months apart and arrived at the same defect independently.
//
// ⚠ NOT REACHABLE FROM THIS UI TODAY, and fixed anyway for the reason #190 gives. Nothing on this
// screen links to another issue: the only way out is "All issues" (it read "‹ Issues" until
// W1.1.8 — a direction rather than a destination), which goes up to the list and DOES remount. One ordinary addition — a parent link (`parent_id` is already on the type), a related
// list, a search result, prev/next — makes it live, and the person adding that link has no reason
// to suspect this file.
//
// MEASURED before the fix existed: with a draft open on issue A, arriving at B and pressing Save
// sent `PATCH /api/track/issues/b {"description":"<the words typed on A>"}`. The three cases below
// were RED; the fourth was already green, which is what makes it worth keeping.
//
// CONTROLS — ~/talyvor-queue/w11-issuestate-controls-5c3a.py, 6 mutations, green baseline,
// sha256 byte-restore:
//   C1 the whole reset removed          -> the 3 positive cases red, the must-stay-green stays green
//   C2 the reset forgets setDraft       -> EXACTLY the description case. This one assertion is what
//                                          stands between a reader and a cross-issue write.
//   C3 the reset forgets setComment     -> EXACTLY the comment case
//   C4 the reset forgets setFailure     -> EXACTLY the refusal case
//   C5 the reset fires on EVERY render  -> the MUST-STAY-GREEN reds, plus four cases in
//                                          writeUnderDeadCredential.test.tsx. The negative half is
//                                          load-bearing: over-resetting eats the keystrokes of the
//                                          issue you are actually on, and it would otherwise pass
//                                          all three positive cases.
//   NEG ordinary growth                 -> 0 red
// ⚠ C1–C4 each ALSO redded pointerAudit.test.ts, and that is an artefact of the harness, not a
// second catcher: deleting lines from IssueDetail.tsx moves the line another file cites.

/**
 * W1.1.8 — THE TICKET, REBUILT IN THE PRODUCT'S OWN LANGUAGE.
 *
 * Everything above this line is about what Track RECORDS and is unchanged by the rebuild. These
 * are about the screen: one idea per region, a page-scale heading that opens it, and — the half
 * that is not decoration — a heading that cannot say the wrong thing in the largest type on the
 * page.
 *
 * ⚠ THE STATES A TICKET HAS ARE NOT THE STATES A LIST HAS, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS NOT A COPY OF
 * W1.1.7's BLOCK. A list is empty or full; a ticket is THERE or it is NOT, and "not" arrives as a
 * 404 that the screen used to render with the same sentence it gave a 500, a 503 and a dead
 * session: "That issue could not be read." Four causes, one sentence, and the only one of the four
 * that is not a fault — the link is stale, or the issue belongs to another workspace — read as a
 * broken product.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE 404 IS DELIBERATELY AMBIGUOUS UPSTREAM, so this screen must not resolve it. Track's
 * `Handler.Get` answers 404 for a foreign id as well as an absent one, in as many words —
 * "SEC-5: scoped read — foreign id → ErrNotFound → 404 (no disclosure, no oracle)" — so a
 * sentence that said "this issue was deleted" would be the browser inventing the disclosure the
 * server refused to make. MEASURED read-only in talyvor-track at `main`, and the status reaches
