// Track's issue search — the fourth of the five AI features W1.7 recorded as "LIVE and reachable
// only by curl", and the only one of the four left that needs neither an editor nor a decision
// about what a button is allowed to CHANGE (triage optionally overwrites priority and labels,
// find-duplicates and sprint-planning are POSTs). track_ai.go said as much when it shipped the
// thread summary: "semantic search is a workspace-wide read that belongs to the list screen, not
// the ticket". This is that list screen.
//
// ── WHAT THIS CARD MAY AND MAY NOT SAY ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠⚠ IT MAY NOT USE THE WORD "SEMANTIC", AND THAT IS MEASURED RATHER THAN CAUTIOUS. Track's route
// is named `semantic-search` and its answer is a BARE ARRAY — no envelope, no per-row source tag,
// no field of any kind recording which half produced it. `SemanticSearch` falls back to plain
// full-text whenever Lens is unavailable, the pool is nil, the embedding call fails, the vector
// query fails, or the embeddings JOIN comes back empty, and its own docstring calls that a
// feature: "The fallback path is invisible to callers — they always get a useful result."
// Measured at track `b6fec98` in a scratch export, the AI-off answer and the AI-on-but-fell-back
// answer are BYTE-IDENTICAL. So a card headed "AI search" would be making, on every single
// result, a claim no response it receives is able to support — and on this deployment
// (TRACK_LENS_MINT_KEY unset) it would be false every time.
//
// ⚠ THE DOCS SIBLING SAYS MORE THAN THIS ONE, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS EVIDENCE, NOT CONFIDENCE.
// SearchDocs.tsx can print "at least one of these came from the semantic index" because Docs tags
// each row `fulltext`/`semantic`/`both`. Track ships no tag, so the one-directional claim
// available over there is unavailable here in BOTH directions. This card therefore says nothing
// about halves at all — the honest sentence is about the SEARCH, not about the machinery.
//
// ⚠ "NOTHING MATCHED" IS A STATEMENT ABOUT THE RESPONSE, NEVER ABOUT THE WORKSPACE. An empty array
// is at least four facts: nothing matched; no search backend is wired (`fullTextFallback` returns
// nil with no error); the store has no pool (`issue.Store.Search` returns nil with no error); or
// the vector path fell through to a full-text query that matched nothing. A deployment where
// search is not plumbed in at all reports "no results" forever, with a 200.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IT COSTS, AND WHY IT IS A SUBMITTED FORM. Where Lens IS wired the semantic half embeds
// the QUERY on every call under the feature tag `track-search` — a metered call billed to the
// workspace and attributed to no issue, because the embedding is of the query and there is no
// issue to charge. Keystroke-driven search would meter every keystroke. On this deployment the
// engine is unavailable, so the full-text path runs and costs nothing; the form is submitted
// either way, because which of those is true is exactly what this app cannot see.
//
// ⚠⚠ THAT PARAGRAPH IS ON SCREEN NOW — SEE CostNote BELOW — AND UNTIL `16d2218` IT WAS NOT. This
// was the FOURTH metered Track surface and the only one that printed nothing: the knowledge was
// in this header, written by whoever measured it, and no reader could reach it. The identical
// shape shipped on the Docs search card (#240). meteredCostCensus.test.tsx is the census over
// Track's whole metered population, so a fifth surface cannot be missed the same way.

/**
 * What a search costs, said where the button is.
 *
 * ⚠ IT IS A PROPERTY OF THE BUTTON, NOT OF THE ANSWER, so it renders with the form and in every
 * outcome — TriageIssue's comment records the same rule for the same reason. The charge, where
 * there is one, is bought on submit and BEFORE Track knows whether anything matched: the Docs
 * census's C2 control measured that deleting the note from the EMPTY branch alone left a whole
 * directory green, and the empty answer is the state that reads most like "nothing happened".
 * Rendering it once, outside the outcome chain, is what makes that branch uncoverable rather than
 * merely covered.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ IT IS CONDITIONAL IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, AND THAT IS MEASURED RATHER THAN CAUTIOUS. The three
 * sibling cards spend on a click and may say so flatly. Here the charge is the half this card is
 * forbidden to name, and `SemanticSearch` falls back silently whenever Lens is unavailable, the
 * pool is nil, or any step fails — so "this search WAS billed" is FALSE on a deployment with no
 * Lens, which is this one, and "was NOT billed" is equally unsupported. Track's answer is a bare
 * array with no field for it (issueSearch.ts). The Docs sibling can end on proof because Docs tags
 * its rows; there is no evidence to read here, in either direction.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT DOES NOT REUSE `meteredCallCopy`. That sentence's payer is the ISSUE, which is true of
 * the three cards — measured, they pass `issue.Identifier` as the Lens feature tag. Search passes
 * the static tag `track-search` and there is no issue to charge, so borrowing the shared sentence
 * would have told the reader that workspace search spend lands on a ticket. The census asserts
 * the payer for exactly that reason.
 *
 * ⚠ THE VOCABULARY IS NARROW ON PURPOSE. searchIssues.test.tsx bans "semantic", "AI", "vector",
 * "embedding" and "full-text" from this card, because no response it receives can say which half
 * served the answer. This sentence is admitted by that guard UNCHANGED — it is about the CHARGE,
 * which is a fact about the route, and says nothing about the machinery that produced any given
 * result. A cost note that needed the ban loosened would have been the wrong sentence.
 *
 * ⚠ PROSE AS JSX TEXT, NOT A STRING CONSTANT — see DroppedNote below for the scanner that reads a
 * quoted string of lowercase words as a Tailwind class list.
