// FindDuplicates — Track's duplicate finder, the third of its five AI features to reach a browser.
//
// ⚠ W1.7 RECORDED, TWICE AND FROM TWO INDEPENDENT SESSIONS, that Track's AI is reachable only by
// curl. The thread summary (#225) and the semantic search (#230) closed two of the five; this
// closes a third. Of the two left, triage optionally OVERWRITES the issue's priority and labels
// (`?apply=true`) and the sprint suggestion needs a cycle screen this app does not have — so this
// is the last one that changes nothing and needs no new surface.
//
// ⚠ IT IS A BUTTON, NOT A PAGE LOAD, BECAUSE IT COSTS. MEASURED, not read: the request that leaves
// Track for Lens carries `X-Talyvor-Feature: <this issue's identifier>` and `claude-haiku-4-6`, so
// the charge lands on this issue's `ai_cost_usd` — the number the Details card above renders.
// WHEN it lands there is a separate fact and the card used to get it wrong: see meteredCallCopy.
// Asking on mount would spend on every ticket anyone opened. There is no cache upstream for this
// one (unlike the summary's hour), so a second press is a second call and a second charge.
//
// ⚠⚠ WHAT THIS CARD MAY NOT SAY, AND WHY. tab-9f27 ran talyvor-track's own handler at `6b31a75`
// over a REAL Postgres and a recording fake Lens (rows in apps/bff/track_duplicates_test.go):
//
//   · `200 []` is AT LEAST FOUR FACTS — nobody matched; somebody matched below Track's 0.7
//     threshold; the model named an issue outside the candidate window, which the id lookup drops
//     in silence; or the window was empty. So the empty arm describes the ANSWER and never claims
//     the issue has no duplicate.
//   · THE WINDOW IS ONE TEAM. A byte-identical twin in another team of the same workspace was
//     measured NOT to be in the prompt, and the answer was `[]`. The card says so out loud,
//     because "no duplicates" over a workspace-wide claim would be false.
//   · THE SUBJECT IS ITS OWN CANDIDATE. Track's prompt carried the issue being asked about under
//     "Existing issues", and echoing that id back produced a row saying the issue duplicates
//     itself at 1.0. `readDuplicates` drops that row and reports that it arrived; this card prints
//     that sentence rather than swallowing it, because the repair is upstream's to make.
//   · THE SCORE IS THE MODEL'S OWN CLAIM, not a measurement — Track passes the number through from
//     the completion. It is drawn with that attribution attached, never as a bare percentage.
export function FindDuplicates({ issueId }: { issueId: string }) {
  // ⚠ THE FILE IS `FindDuplicates.tsx` AND THE READER IS `duplicates.ts`, WHICH IS NOT A STYLE
  // CHOICE. Naming this component file `Duplicates.tsx` made `import … from './duplicates'`
  // resolve to THIS FILE on a case-insensitive filesystem (macOS, the default): the import
  // silently returned the module importing it, and every test failed with "element type is
  // invalid … got: undefined" rather than a missing module. It would have resolved correctly on
  // CI's Linux, so the two would have disagreed. Every other pair in this area already avoids a
  // case-only collision (SearchIssues.tsx/issueSearch.ts, AISummary.tsx/summary.ts).
  //
  // ⚠ THE ANSWER BELONGS TO THE ISSUE IT WAS ASKED ABOUT. React Router matches /track/issues/:id to
  // ONE element, so arriving at another issue changes `issueId` underneath this component without
  // remounting it — the same trap AISummary's reset guards. Here the issue id IS the mutation's
  // variable, so the check is a comparison rather than a state reset: an answer whose variable is
  // not the issue on screen is not shown at all, and there is no window in which A's duplicates
  // are drawn under B's title.
