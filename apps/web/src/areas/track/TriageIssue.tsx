// TriageIssue — Track's triage suggestion, the fourth of its five AI features to reach a browser,
// and the first to reach one WITHOUT the write half it ships with.
//
// ⚠⚠ WHY THIS FEATURE SAT UNREACHABLE FOR SIX CLAIMS OF W1.7, AND WHAT CHANGED. talyvor-track's
// `ai.Handler.Triage` takes `?apply=true` and then OVERWRITES the issue's priority AND labels with
// the model's suggestion, discarding the write error (`_, _ = h.issues.Update(…)`). The queue's
// verdict — "a button that silently rewrites two fields on a ticket is a product decision and not a
// session's" — is right and stands. It is not a reason to leave the SUGGESTION unreachable: reading
// what the model thinks changes nothing. So this card asks, and the BFF forwards NO query string at
// all, so the apply path is not "off by default" here — from a browser it does not exist
// (apps/bff/track_triage.go, and TestTrackTriage_TheApplyParameterNeverTravels).
//
// ⚠ IT IS A BUTTON, NOT A PAGE LOAD, BECAUSE IT COSTS. MEASURED, not read: the request leaving
// Track for Lens carries `X-Talyvor-Feature: <this issue's identifier>` and `claude-haiku-4-6`, so
// the charge lands on this issue's `ai_cost_usd` — the number the Details card above renders.
// WHEN it lands there is a separate fact and the card used to get it wrong: see meteredCallCopy.
// Asking on mount would spend on every ticket anyone opened, and there is no cache upstream for
// this one, so a second press is a second call and a second charge.
//
// ⚠⚠ WHAT THIS CARD MAY NOT SAY, ALL OF IT MEASURED (tab-7f6b, talyvor-track's own engine at
// `655a0a0` over a recording fake Lens; rows in apps/bff/track_triage_test.go):
//
//   · `suggested_priority: 0` IS TWO FACTS. Track's vocabulary calls 0 "None"; Go's zero value fills
//     the field when the model omits it, and the struct carries no omitempty. The two replies are
//     byte-identical on the wire, so drawing "None" would report a suggestion no model may have
//     made. The card says which two facts it cannot separate.
//   · `confidence: 0` IS THE SAME SHAPE, so a 0 draws no percentage at all.
//   · A PRIORITY OUTSIDE 0..4 IS NOT DRAWN — measured travelling intact (9, -1). `priorityLabel`
//     ends `?? 'None'`, which would turn a value nobody recognises into a confident answer: the
//     tier-dot defect (#149) in another costume.
//   · `is_duplicate` AND `suggested_assignee` ARE NEVER DRAWN. The triage prompt asks the model for
//     priority, labels, a summary and a confidence — and for neither of those two. They ride on
//     every response as zero values, so a card reporting "not a duplicate" would be answering a
//     question nobody asked. Track's duplicate finder is a different route with its own prompt and
//     its own card.
