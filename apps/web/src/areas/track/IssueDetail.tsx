// IssueDetail — the ticket.
//
// ⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS. The suite rendered Ref, Title and Status and nothing else: you could see that
// an issue existed and never read it. A tracker whose tickets cannot be opened is not a tracker,
// and that single gap did more damage than every missing page combined.
//
// ⚠ ALMOST NONE OF THIS IS NEW PLUMBING, WHICH IS THE POINT. trackUpdateIssue already forwards its
// body verbatim, so all twelve of Track's updatableFields were reachable the whole time.
// /api/track/teams was proxied with no caller. filterIssues, memberName and teamIdentifier were
// written in data.ts and nothing imported them. The only genuinely missing piece was POST on the
// comments route — the GET half already existed, so the app could show a thread it could not answer.
//
// ⚠ TEAM IS SHOWN, NOT EDITED, and that is not an oversight: team_id is NOT in Track's
// updatableFields (title, description, status, priority, assignee_id, project_id, cycle_id,
// parent_id, due_date, labels, sort_order, lens_feature). Offering a control that silently drops
// the field would be worse than showing the value.
//
// ⚠ THE AI COST IS THE POINT OF THE SCREEN. issues.ai_cost_usd is a running sum of Track's
// ai_spend_events ledger, attributed per request. No other tracker has it, it has worked all along,
// and until now it was invisible.
//
// ── W1.1.8: WHAT THE REBUILD CHANGED, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DID NOT ───────────────────────
//
// The screen was a back-link, a title, and then four anonymous `<Card>`s in a column — Description,
// Details, Comments, and the three AI panels between them — so a reader arriving by landmark got
// ONE stop on a page that answers six different questions. It is now six REGIONS, one idea each,
// every one a named landmark, opened by the console's single page-scale heading (Region.tsx).
//
// ⚠ THE THREE AI CARDS KEPT THEIR CARDS ON PURPOSE. They are shared with `aiCostClaim.test.tsx`,
// which renders each one STANDALONE and counts the metered-call sentence across all three; they are
// also W1.1.8's neighbours rather than its subject (FindDuplicates.tsx and TriageIssue.tsx are named
// by no item). A region names the question — "what Track's AI makes of it" — and the cards inside it
// name the three answers, which is Overview's pattern applied one level up.
//
// ⚠ AND `TrackArea.tsx` IS UNTOUCHED, the same deliberate non-change W1.1.7 recorded: it routes
// BOTH Track screens, so a branch that edits it collides in main rather than in either CI.

const UNASSIGNED = '__unassigned__'
/** The "no project" sentinel, for the same Radix reason as UNASSIGNED. */
const NO_PROJECT = '__no_project__'

// ⚠ THE STATUS AND PRIORITY WORDS COME FROM ./format AND ARE NOT WRITTEN HERE. This screen used
// to speak two vocabularies for one field at the same moment: <StatusPill> beside these controls
// renders "In progress" through `statusLabel`, while the control itself mapped the RAW enum, so
// the row read "Status · In progress · in_progress". Priority was the mirror image — a hand-rolled
// five-entry list here, and an exported, documented, unit-tested `priorityLabel` with no callers.
// issueVocabulary.test.tsx asserts the rendered control per enum value; format.test.ts pins the
// words against model.go. Do not re-inline either list.

/**
 * THE FOUR HEADLINES, AND THE ONE A LIST DOES NOT HAVE.
 *
 * W1.1.7 wrote three of these for the issue LIST, from the rule this area has stated since its
 * first commit: "Track is not deployed here" (503), "Track is broken" (5xx) and "there is nothing
 * here" mean completely different things to a tester, and laundering any into another tells them
 * their work vanished or that a fault is normal. A page-scale heading is the LOUDEST claim on the
 * screen, so it is the worst place to collapse them.
 *
 * ⚠ A TICKET HAS A FOURTH STATE, AND THE OLD SCREEN GAVE ALL FOUR ONE SENTENCE. `if (!it)` printed
 * "That issue could not be read." for a 404, a 500, a 503 and a dead session alike — and the 404 is
 * the ONLY one of the four that is not a fault. The link is stale, or the issue lives in another
 * workspace; nothing is broken, and the reader was told the product had failed.
 *
 * ⚠ THE 404 IS AMBIGUOUS UPSTREAM AND THIS SCREEN MUST NOT RESOLVE IT. talyvor-track's
 * `issue.Handler.Get` answers 404 for a FOREIGN id as well as an absent one, and says why in its
 * own source — "SEC-5: scoped read — foreign id → ErrNotFound → 404 (no disclosure, no oracle)".
 * "This issue was deleted" would be the browser inventing the disclosure the server refused to
 * make, so the sentence is true of both readings and stops there.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT REACHES THE BROWSER INTACT, which is what makes this a state and not a decoration:
 * `apps/bff/lens.go#forwardProduct` ends `w.WriteHeader(resp.StatusCode)` and copies the body — no
 * remapping anywhere on the path. Measured read-only in both repositories rather than assumed,
 * because a discriminator no upstream can trigger is a branch that cannot fire.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS A SCREEN-LEVEL READING OF 404, NOT A CHANGE TO `lib/productState.ts`. That module says
 * "404/500/502/403 remain genuine faults" and it is right about the reads it classifies, which are
 * COLLECTIONS: a 404 from a list route means the BFF has no such route, which is a fault. This one
 * read is by id, where 404 is the upstream's ordinary answer for "not yours, or not there".

  // reader navigating by rotor; a button that puts the caret in the field it is talking about is a
  // destination. The comment box is always mounted so a ref reaches it directly; the description
  // EDITOR does not exist until the draft opens, so that one focus is deferred by one commit.
  //
  // ⚠ THIS NAME WAS ONCE FORCED BY A DEFECT IN AN INSTRUMENT, AND THAT DEFECT IS NOW REPAIRED
  // (W1.1.18). The history is kept because the constraint is gone and a reader should not have to
  // wonder whether it is still there: `figureFace.test.ts` used to classify a call as money by
  // `/usd|cents|cost|price/i` against the BARE IDENTIFIER, so `setFoc-usD-raft` matched `usd`, and
  // the guard failed with "money rendered in the body sans" over a boolean. It now matches a
  // camelCase SEGMENT (`isMoneyName`), so `setFocusDraft` does not match and `formatUSD` still
  // does — the repair `\b` alone could not make, because `formatUSD` has no word boundary before
  // `USD`. `setFocusDraft` is pinned in that file's NOT_MONEY list, so this exact name is now a
  // standing control rather than a hazard.
  //
  // ⚠ THE NAME IS LEFT AS IT IS ON PURPOSE. `focusEditor` describes what it does — the description
  // EDITOR is the thing focused — so renaming it back would be churn on a screen to celebrate a
  // fix in a test. It is now a choice about naming and no longer a constraint.
  //
  // ⚠ ONE HALF IS STILL A KNOWN LIMIT, DELIBERATELY: the same file's `tags()` reads a TypeScript
  // generic as a JSX open tag, so `useRef<…>` below still opens a "tag" that never closes and can
  // put an ordinary statement in scope. It is pinned rather than fixed because it can only ever ADD

  // React Router matches /track/issues/:id to ONE <Route> element, so moving from issue A to
  // issue B changes `id` underneath this component and does NOT remount it — every useState above
  // survives. MEASURED, not reasoned about (the probe is now IssueDetail.test.tsx's 'the state on
  // this screen belongs to the issue that is open'): with a draft open on A, arriving at B sent
  //
  //     PATCH /api/track/issues/b {"description":"<the words typed on A>"}
  //
  // — A's description written into B, under B's title, from a Save the reader had every reason to
  // press. The typed comment carried across the same way, and a refusal sentence about A stayed on
  // screen over B.
  //
  // ⚠ IT IS NOT REACHABLE FROM THIS UI TODAY and it is still fixed here. Nothing on this screen
  // links to another issue — "All issues" goes up to the list and DOES remount — so it takes one
  // ordinary addition (a parent link; `parent_id` is already on the type, a related list, a search
  // result, prev/next) to become silent data loss, and whoever adds that link has no reason to
  // suspect this file. This is the same shape and the same decision as `f4c1e97` (#190) in

          the region is between its subject and its price, and `meteredCallCopy` says "above" in
          those words, so the order is load-bearing rather than aesthetic. WHEN that price appears
          is a different question and the cards answer it: see meteredCallCopy in ./format. Nothing
          on the AI request path writes that number.

          ⚠ FindDuplicates AND TriageIssue ASK ABOUT THE ISSUE, NOT THE THREAD — its title and
          description — which is why all three sit above the comments rather than beside them.
          Neither carries a `key`: each answer is bound to the issue id it was asked with, inside
          the component, so a route change cannot leave one issue's duplicates under another's
          title. TriageIssue deliberately does LESS than its upstream: Track's triage route can
          APPLY its suggestion (`?apply=true` overwrites priority and labels and discards the write
          error), so this app asks for the suggestion and the BFF forwards no query at all, which
          is what makes the write unreachable rather than merely unused (apps/bff/track_triage.go). */}
