// The one card the Track area draws for a read it cannot serve — and the replacement for
// fourteen invented issues.
//
// Four states, each a fact about THIS deployment as observed a moment ago:
//
//   loading      → checking.
//   unconfigured → the 503 the BFF returns when TRACK_* is unset. Named as state, not fault:
//                  nothing is broken, the product simply is not wired here.
//   error        → anything else. Named as a failure without pretending to know the cause,
//                  and never laundered into "off" — a broken upstream must not read as calm.
//   configured   → the upstream answered. The data is REACHABLE and this view does not read
//                  it yet, which is the honest sentence and a visible prompt to finish. The
//                  screen still shows no rows, because inventing them is the thing we removed.
//
// None of these sentences is reachable without a response, which is the point: the copy cannot
// outlive its truth the way the #339 cache caption did. The day Track appears, this card
// changes what it says with no edit here.
