// B27.31 — what /documentation says, kept apart from how it is drawn so the test can walk every
// claim. Each claim names ONE thing a person can do today and links to the screen or route that
// does it; Documentation.test.tsx resolves every internal link against the routes the app
// actually mounts, so a screen that is removed or renamed fails the build instead of leaving a
// link here to "Nothing at this address".
//
// ONLY WHAT SHIPS. Each claim was read off the screen it links to (or the help page that screen
// links to), not off a roadmap. Talyvor Code is described as the Marketplace extension and the
// CLI, the two surfaces a user installs today; the JetBrains plugin is not on a marketplace and is
// not listed. Lens's routes are in lens-routes.json, extracted from Lens's source and checked by
// scripts/lens-routes.mjs in CI.
