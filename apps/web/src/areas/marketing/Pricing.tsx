// /pricing (B5.2) — what anything costs, for a buyer who has not signed up. Public, OUTSIDE the
// AuthGate like /marketing, and built the same way: no router context, plain anchors, Landing's
// instrument language.
//
// ⚠ EVERY FIGURE IS SERVED. The peg and the top-up range come from GET /api/pricing (see
// pricingApi.ts), and the page prints that address so a buyer can check it. What is written here is
// only the RULES the figures obey — how a request is charged, what is not charged — each read from
// talyvor-lens:
//   request charge   internal/proxy/agent_allocator.go settleReservationBasis:
//                    ceil(delivered USD / peg × 1e6) µLXC — the model's catalog rate, rounded UP
//   no top-up fee    internal/billing/billing.go lxcForCents: usdCents × ulxcPerCent, exact
//   the floor/cap    internal/billing/billing.go minTopUpCents / maxTopUpCents and their reasons
//   no seats         internal/billing has no seat or per-member charge anywhere
// "No subscription REQUIRED", not "no subscription": a deployment may also sell a plan (B1.5), but
// nothing needs one — prepaid credits alone run every request.
//
// B28.4 — credit for agents, the plans, and the Marketplace bill, each listed once. Pooling is one line
// under what a request costs: a saving, not the price.
//
// B29.5 — the brand board's look: an eyebrow over every section and a teal rule under its headline
// (Landing's pieces), every card a raised panel with a 1px line border, every price in IBM Plex Mono
// with tabular figures, one teal button on each plan card, and Pro outlined in accent. Nothing here
// says "most popular": no figure measures it, so only the outline marks it.
//
// B32.14 — the plans section is the approved price card (PriceCard.tsx): for companies, for individuals,
// and the fees on any plan, every figure from GET /api/pricing — the same read /plans sells from, so this
// page cannot quote a price that screen does not charge.
