// The marketing landing (/marketing, OUTSIDE the AuthGate — see App.tsx). It must render with no

// ARRIVES at a real screen rather than merely existing.
//
// ── DESIGN STANCE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The brand board's WEBSITE HERO tile (brand-v4 BRAND.md, "The marketing page"; B29.4): the drawn
// logo lockup in the header, an eyebrow over every headline, one teal rule per section, raised
// panels with a 1px line border instead of shadows, the four brand icons, and every money figure in
// IBM Plex Mono with tabular figures. The hero photograph bleeds off the right edge behind a gradient
// from the canvas; on a phone it moves under the text. The
// copy is unchanged — only the look moved. Display sizes are still the preset's; anything the
// preset has no token for (the photo, the scrim) lives in the page's own <style> block,
// on the theme's variables, so the tokens stay the one source of colour.
//
// The one thing a visitor should remember is the PRODUCT: every AI agent gets a wallet, and the
// rules on it are enforced before the model call or the payment, not reconciled afterwards.
// Pooling is one cost-saving feature with one section, never the pitch (B28.2).
//
// ── COPY STANCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every figure on this page is MEASURED — the settled pooled hit in economics.ts, from one real
// ledger row, labelled as real. The one percentage (the pooled discount) is DERIVED from that row
// below rather than typed, so it cannot disagree with the figures printed beside it. There is no
// projected curve and no "toward zero": a shape drawn from a claim is not a measurement.

// ── THE CONTACT ADDRESS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This page used to hardcode hello@talyvor.com as its only call to action, under a comment saying
// the alias did not route yet. It shipped anyway: a buyer's first action went nowhere, and no gate
// could catch it because a comment cannot be executed. The address is now CONFIGURATION, and its
// absence is a state the page renders rather than a warning someone has to remember. Unset ⇒ no
// email CTA is drawn at all. Deliberately NOT defaulted: a fallback address is how the dead link
// survived the first time.
//
// ⚠ IT IS A BUILD-TIME VARIABLE. Vite inlines import.meta.env when the bundle is compiled, so
// setting VITE_CONTACT_EMAIL on the running container does nothing at all — the value has to be
// present in the environment of the `pnpm build` that produces the assets. See deploy/README.

                    not complete OAuth anyway, since the Google app is in Testing mode. That premise
                    was inferred from config and was FALSE — Google's Testing state exempts apps
                    requesting only openid, email and profile, which is exactly what apps/bff/auth.go
                    requests. Nobody is stopped at Google; the only wall is ours
                    (OIDC_ALLOWED_EMAILS). /signup tells a stranger what this is and who may enter —
                    derived from the gate, so it is right in both configurations — before handing
