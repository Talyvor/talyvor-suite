/**
 * THE FOUR HEADLINES, AND WHY ADDING A HEADING TO THIS SCREEN ADDED FOUR WAYS TO BE WRONG.
 *
 * The card said "Spaces" in every state this screen has — loading, off, failed, and a workspace
 * full of them. That was safe because it claimed nothing, and it is also why the screen said
 * nothing: the largest words on the page were a noun. W1.1.9 gives it the console's page-scale
 * step, and a claim can be false.
 *
 * ⚠ THE OBVIOUS PREDICATE — a bare test of the row count against zero — IS WRONG TWICE: it is
 * true while the read is in flight, and true when the read FAILED. So "nothing is written down
 * here" would be printed over both a loading screen and a broken Docs, in the biggest type the
 * console has. The same repair as the issue list: the headline is chosen from the read's own
 * state. ⚠ AND THE EXPRESSION IS DESCRIBED RATHER THAN QUOTED, deliberately —
 * `emptyVsFault.test.ts` compares the RAW file's empty-branch count against the
 * COMMENT-STRIPPED one, so prose that quotes the branch makes raw exceed stripped and reports
 * a stripper eating live code. It caught this docstring on the first run.
 *
 * ⚠ AND OFF IS NOT BROKEN. This area has said so since its first commit — a 503 from the BFF's
 * proxyProduct (and a 404 from a BFF built before the Docs routes) means "not wired here", and the
 * caption at the bottom of this screen has carried that distinction all along. The heading carries
 * it now too, which is the loudest place it has ever been said, and it is why there are FOUR
 * headlines rather than three.

            here, still gated on the read having succeeded.

            naming: it existed to SUPPRESS the "proxy answered with an error" caption on a dead
            credential, so that this screen would not say what the bar at the top of the app
            already says. The caption it suppressed is now `PanelFailure`, which makes the same
            distinction itself ("Unavailable." on a 401, "Couldn't load spaces." otherwise). One

          ⚠ THAT GATE IS WHY THE INDICES STAY CONTIGUOUS RATHER THAN FIXED PER IDEA. The two gated
          regions are the LAST two, so an off deployment renders `00 01` and a live one `00 01 02
