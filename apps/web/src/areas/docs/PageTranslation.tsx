// Translate one page — the fourth AI control to reach a browser in this product, and the second
// whose cost lands on a document rather than on the workspace at large.
//
// ── WHY THIS ONE COULD BE BUILT, LIKE SUMMARISE AND UNLIKE THE OTHER THREE ───
//
// Same argument PageSummary.tsx makes, and it holds for the same measured reason: the family needs
// the editor to put the result BACK, not to produce it. `POST /workspaces/{ws}/ai/translate` is
// text in, text out. A translation is read beside the page rather than pasted into it — you do not
// replace an English document with its French version in place — so it is finished when it is
// displayed. `shorter`, `longer` and `grammar` still are not: their output REPLACES the text you
// sent, and this app has nowhere to put a replacement.
//
// ── THE DEFAULT THIS COMPONENT REFUSES TO HAVE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT ─────
//
// MEASURED upstream (tab-7c3e, talyvor-docs 6aca7db, a scratch `git archive` export, its real
// Translate handler over a fake Lens that captures the SYSTEM PROMPT — the only place the target
// language actually lands):
//
//	{"text":"hello","language":"French"}        → 200, 1 completion, "…to French…"
//	{"text":"hello"}                            → 200, 1 completion, "…to English…"
//	{"text":"hello","language":""}              → 200, 1 completion, "…to English…"
//	{"text":"hello","target_language":"French"} → 200, 1 completion, "…to English…"
//
// A missing language is NOT an error upstream. It is a billed completion that answers in English,
// and it is indistinguishable from success at the status code. So this component ships with NO
// default language and no pre-selected option: a default here would be a second author of that
// same silent choice, made in a component this time instead of in `defaultLang`. The user names
// the language or nothing is sent.
//
// ── AND NO LIST OF LANGUAGES, FOR THE SAME REASON ────────────────────────────
//
// A `<select>` of "the languages we support" would be this screen inventing a vocabulary that
// exists nowhere below it: Docs interpolates whatever string it is given straight into a prompt,
// so "fr", "Français" and "Brazilian Portuguese" are all equally real to it. A free-text field is
// the honest control for a free-text parameter. The one rule is the one that was measured — blank
// spends money and lies — and it is enforced here and again at the BFF, which is the half that
// holds when the caller is not this screen.
//
// ── WHAT IT COSTS, SAID HONESTLY OR NOT AT ALL ──────────────────────────────
//
// This operation names a page, so Docs binds Lens's request id to it and the charge lands on THAT
// page's `own_ai_cost_usd` under the feature tag `docs-ai-translate`. The response carries no
// number and this app has no second source for one, so the sentence names where the charge lands
// and shows no figure — the rule AskAI.tsx and PageSummary.tsx both follow.
