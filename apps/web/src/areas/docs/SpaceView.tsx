//
// It used to render seven FABRICATED pages from ./fixtures.ts — titles, depths, locked chips, view
// counts of 128 / 64 / 31 / 12 / 7 / 45 / 90 — under a footnote claiming the BFF did not serve the
// read. Those are gone and none return: SAME RULE AS THE TRACK SCREEN. An empty space renders empty
// because the API returned [], not because a fixture said so, and "No pages yet" is the correct
// output for a space nobody has written in.
//
// Writes work now because Docs takes the SESSION's workspace (apps/bff docsWorkspaceFor) instead of
// a pinned one, and because Docs enumerates workspaces from Track rather than from the workspaces it
// already holds content for — the cold-start deadlock that made a brand-new identity's first page
// 403 (talyvor-track bf60842, talyvor-docs c970329).
//
// buildTree/countNodes stay in ./tree.ts, unit-tested, for when this list becomes a tree.

  // above survives. MEASURED, not reasoned about (the probe is now docsWrites.test.tsx's 'the
  // create form belongs to one space'): with 'A title meant for AAA' in the box on A, arriving at
  // B and pressing Create page sent
  //
  //     POST /api/docs/spaces/sp-b/pages {"title":"A title meant for AAA"}
  //
  // — a page created in B under a title meant for A, from a button the reader had every reason to
  // press; and a refusal about A stayed on screen over B.
  //
  // ⚠ IT IS NOT REACHABLE FROM THIS UI TODAY and it is still fixed here. Nothing on this screen
  // links to a sibling space — Back and the crumbs both go up to /docs and DO remount — so it
  // takes one ordinary addition (a space switcher, a recent list, a search result) to become a
  // page written into the wrong space, and whoever adds it has no reason to suspect this file.
  //
  // ⚠ THIS IS THE THIRD SCREEN IN THIS APP WITH THIS DEFECT, after PageView.tsx one level down
  // (`f4c1e97`, #190) and Track's IssueDetail.tsx (`d82bcfb`, #192). The first two were each
  // found by someone already reading the file; this one was found by asking the question of every
  // route in the app — the three <Route> elements that read a param and hold state — and it was
  // the only one of the three left unguarded.
  //
  // Resetting during render rather than in an effect is React's documented way to adjust state
  // when the thing it belongs to changes: the reset lands BEFORE the browser sees anything, so
  // the previous space's words are never painted under the new space's name.
  //
  // ⚠ AND THAT LAST SENTENCE IS THE ONE THING HERE NO TEST IN THIS REPO CAN SEE — MEASURED, so it
  // is not read as something the suite enforces. Moving these three lines into a
  // `useEffect(..., [spaceId])` leaves ALL 1220 tests green (control C7 in
  // ~/talyvor-queue/w11-spacestate-controls-8b47.py): jsdom and RTL observe state after the
  // effects have flushed, so the intermediate paint an effect would allow is invisible to them.
  // The three cases below pin WHICH space the words belong to; only a browser can pin WHEN. The
  // identical sentence in PageView.tsx and Track's IssueDetail.tsx is unpinned for the same
  // reason, and no floor or count would have shown it — only mutating the mechanism did.
