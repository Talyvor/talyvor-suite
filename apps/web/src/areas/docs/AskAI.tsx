// The first browser control for any AI feature in this product.
//
// ── WHAT WAS TRUE BEFORE THIS FILE ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// talyvor-docs ships eight AI operations behind `/v1/workspaces/{ws}/ai/…` and talyvor-track
// ships its own. Measured across apps/web/src at suite `d234144`: NOT ONE file named an `/ai/`
// address, and `ai_available` appeared in zero of them. The only reference to any of it was a
// comment. Every one of those features was reachable only by curl.
//
// Ask is the one that needs no editor: a question, an answer, and the pages it was drawn from.
//
// ── THE THREE STATES, AND WHY THE THIRD IS THE POINT ─────────────────────────
//
//   · Docs not wired here          → the spaces query already says so; this card is not offered.
//   · Docs wired, AI unconfigured  → 503 + code AI_UNAVAILABLE. DIFFERENT INSTRUCTION.
//   · Docs wired, AI configured    → an answer.
//
// The middle state is the reason lib/productState.ts gained `isAIUnavailable`. Docs answers 503
// when its Lens credential is missing, and the BFF answers 503 when this deployment has no Docs
// at all — one status, two opposite diagnoses. Read off the status alone (which is what
// isUnconfigured did, and all this app had) a healthy Docs with no AI key renders as "Docs is not
// configured on this deployment", sending an operator to check DOCS_* variables that are correct.
// productState.ts's own header records that mistake costing a day the last time it was made.
//
// ── WHAT IT COSTS, SAID HONESTLY OR NOT AT ALL ───────────────────────────────
//
// Every ask is a metered Lens completion billed to this workspace. It is attributed to NO PAGE:
// Engine.AskDocs passes an empty page id by design ("an answer drawn from several pages belongs
// to none of them"), so nothing lands in page_ai_spend_events and no page's own_ai_cost_usd
// moves. The response carries no cost field, and this screen has no second source for one — so it
// says where the charge lands and shows no number. A per-answer figure here would be invented.

/**
 * Maps a source URL from DOCS' frontend to THIS app's reader route, and refuses anything else.
 *
 * ⚠ THE UPSTREAM URL IS NOT AN ADDRESS IN THIS APP. talyvor-docs builds `/spaces/{id}/pages/{id}`
 * against its OWN origin (internal/ai/handler.go pageURL, whose comment says the host is unknown
 * to the server). Rendered verbatim as an href it would navigate this SPA to `/spaces/…`, which
 * this app does not route — a dead link on every citation, and a silent one, because the SPA
 * fallback answers 200 with the app shell.
 *
 * The suite's reader is that same path under `/docs`, so the mapping is a prefix. Anything that
 * does not have the expected shape (empty, absolute, a different family) returns null and is
 * rendered as plain text: a source that cannot be linked is still a source worth naming, and a
 * guessed link is worse than none.
