// Generate a changelog entry on this page — the fifth W1.7 control to reach a browser, and the
// FIRST one that is not an AI call.
//
// ── WHY THIS ONE COULD BE BUILT, AND ON A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT FROM THE OTHER FOUR ──
//
// Summarise and translate could be built because their result is READ rather than inserted, so
// they need no editor. This one needs no editor for a stronger reason: it does not produce text
// for a human to place anywhere. `POST …/changelog/generate` WRITES its own row, on its own
// table, with its own shape — the page's document is never touched. Whether the entry's
// ProseMirror `content` is later editable is the W2.3 question and is untouched here.
//
// ── WHAT IT COSTS, AND IT IS NOT MONEY ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// W1.7 lists changelog generation among "eight AI features, every one a metered Lens call". That
// is false for this one, MEASURED rather than read: `GenerateFromIssues` reaches Lens never — it
// asks Track for each issue and groups them by label (talyvor-docs
// internal/changelog/store.go#GenerateFromIssues). No completion, no feature tag, no page's
// `own_ai_cost_usd` moves. So this card must NOT print the cost sentence the other four print;
// stating a charge that does not exist is as false as hiding one that does.
//
// What a click DOES cost is a row. It persists on this page, a later PATCH can retitle it, and
// `…/changelog/entries/{id}/publish` puts it into the workspace's public RSS feed
// (internal/changelog/handler.go#Handler.Feed). That is what the sentence beside the result says.
//
// ── THE STATE THIS COMPONENT REFUSES TO BE IN, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT ─────
//
// MEASURED against talyvor-docs' own Generate route at ce997ff — the real route, the real
// permission.Enforcer, real Postgres and the real trackintegration.Client (tab-6d1a, a `git
// archive` scratch export in /tmp; that repository is held by another tab and was never written
// to):
//
//	{"version":"v1.0.0","issue_ids":[]}             → 201 Created, one durable row
//	{"version":"v1.1.0"}                            → 201 Created, one durable row
//	{"version":"v1.2.0","issue_ids":null}           → 201 Created, one durable row
//	{"version":"v5.0.0","issue_ids":["","  ","\t"]} → 201 Created, "Generated from 3 issues"
//
// and the row the first one wrote, read back with SQL: summary "Generated from 0 issues", body
// `…"text":"No issues."…`. Nothing on that path has an empty-list precondition. The last row is
// the worse one — it claims a count of three over three EMPTY bullets. So a "Generate" button
// that fires with nothing selected produces a permanent, publishable release note that documents
// nothing, and answers 201 while doing it. The button does not fire.
//
// ── AND NO VERSION RULE, FOR THE REASON PageTranslation HAS NO LANGUAGE LIST ─
//
// Upstream owns the version vocabulary and enforces it: measured, 400 with its own message for
// "", "   " and "banana", and 201 for both "v1.0.0" and "2026-08-18". A rule here would be a
// screen authoring a vocabulary it does not own, and it would drift the day Docs widens the
// regexp. The refusal that IS here exists because upstream has no rule at all for it.
