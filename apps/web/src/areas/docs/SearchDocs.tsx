// Semantic page search — the second AI feature W1.7 listed as reachable only by curl, and the
// other one of the eight that needs no editor.
//
// ── WHAT THIS CARD MAY AND MAY NOT SAY ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Docs' search runs two halves: full text in Postgres, and a semantic half that embeds the query
// through Lens and matches page vectors. The response merges them and tags each row `fulltext`,
// `semantic` or `both`.
//
// ⚠⚠ THE ENVELOPE HAS NO FIELD FOR WHETHER THE SEMANTIC HALF RAN. MEASURED, not read: at docs
// `7bfa1cf`, its own Search handler mounted over a stub store with Lens unconfigured — which is
// this deployment — answers `?q=auth` with `200 {"results":[…"source":"fulltext"…],"total":1}` and
// `?q=auth&type=semantic` with `200 {"results":[],"total":0}`. `SemanticSearch.Search` returns an
// empty slice and NO error when `IsEnabled()` is false, and the handler merges that in silently.
//
// So the sentence a screen most wants to write here — "semantic search is not configured on this
// deployment" — is one no response can support: an all-full-text answer looks identical when the
// half ran and matched nothing. What IS available is one-directional, and it is all this card
// claims: a row tagged `semantic` or `both` proves the half ran; nothing proves it did not.
//
// ⚠⚠ AND THE CARD SAID BOTH HALVES OF THAT WRONG, MEASURED, ON THE ROW SHAPE UPSTREAM ACTUALLY
// SHIPS. The `dropped` note in search.ts records that talyvor-docs has twice served a hit this app
// cannot draw, and BOTH TIMES it was a semantic hit — so the undrawable row is the proof-carrying
// row, not an unrelated edge. Driven through this component:
//
//   one `source:"semantic"` row with no title      → "Nothing in this workspace matched", "1 result
//                                                     arrived and could not be drawn", and "this
//                                                     answer CANNOT SAY whether the semantic half
//                                                     ran" — while holding the proof that it had.
//   one full-text row drawn + one semantic dropped → "At least one of THESE came from the semantic
//                                                     index", pointing at a list where none did.
//
// The first hedged over evidence it was holding; the second is the worse one — a false sentence
// about a visible list. One root: the card read "the half ran" and wrote "one of these", so where
// the evidence arrived was discarded. `semantic` and `semanticShown` are now two facts and the
// sentence is chosen from both, in evidenceNote, once.
//
// ⚠ THAT IS ALSO WHY THERE IS NO type TOGGLE. A "Semantic only" control would, on a deployment
// without Lens, empty the list every time and be unable to say why — a button whose only visible
// effect is an empty panel it must then hedge about. The BFF route accepts all three types and is
// tested on them (docs_search.go), so the contract is complete; the CONTROL waits until the answer
// can say whether the half ran. Adding the toggle is a decision about a claim, not about a widget.
//
// ⚠ WHAT IT COSTS. The full-text half is Postgres and free. The semantic half embeds the query via
// Lens on every call, so where Lens is wired a search is a metered call billed to this workspace
// and attributed to no page — the embedding is of the QUERY, and there is no page to charge. That
// is why this is a submitted form and not a keystroke-driven one: Docs' own SPA debounces at 300ms
// and its search package sizes a rate limiter for ~200 embeddings a minute from one typist.
//
// ⚠⚠ EVERY WORD OF THAT PARAGRAPH WAS TRUE AND LIVED ONLY HERE. Four sibling Docs cards printed a
// cost sentence to the reader; this one — the highest-frequency metered surface in the product —
// printed nothing, and the knowledge sat in this comment where no reader could reach it. It is now
// on screen: see CostNote below, and meteredCostCensus.test.tsx for the census over all five
// surfaces that makes "a card that spends says so" a rule rather than four coincidences.

/**
 * What the search cost, keyed on the SAME evidence `evidenceNote` is keyed on.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS CARD IS THE ONE METERED DOCS SURFACE THAT SAID NOTHING, and the fact was already in this
 * file — the "⚠ WHAT IT COSTS" paragraph in the header above states it in full. It was written by
 * whoever measured it and no reader ever saw it. meteredCostCensus.test.tsx is the guard on the
 * whole population so the next surface cannot be missed the same way.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THE SENTENCE HAS TWO BRANCHES AND THAT IS NOT HEDGING — IT IS THE SAME CONSTRAINT THE REST OF
 * THIS CARD OBEYS. The four sibling cards spend on a click, so each may say "This summary WAS a
 * metered call" flatly. Here the charge is the SEMANTIC half, and the envelope has no field saying
 * whether that half ran (see the header). On a deployment with no Lens the half returns an empty
 * list that merges in silently and NOTHING was billed. So an unconditional "this search was a
 * metered Lens call" would be a false claim on exactly the deployment this one is — the same
 * defect class #239 deleted from Track's three cards, re-introduced on a fifth surface.
 *
 * A row tagged `semantic` or `both` proves the half ran, which proves the embedding was bought.
 * That is the only state in which this card may use the past tense.
 *
 * ⚠ IT IS RENDERED ONLY WHERE A SEARCH ACTUALLY RAN — the results and empty branches. A fault arm
 * makes NO claim about money, because a failed read may be the BFF failing to dial (nothing spent)
 * or Docs failing after the embedding was bought (something spent), and the response cannot tell
 * them apart. FindDuplicates records the same rule for the same reason.
 *
 * ⚠ THE UNPROVEN BRANCH DOES NOT RE-HEDGE, AND THE FIRST DRAFT DID. It ended "…this answer cannot
 * say whether this search was billed", which is a FOURTH sentence saying what `cannotSayCopy`
 * exists to say once — and two existing tests caught it immediately by matching two elements where
 * they expect one. `evidenceNote` already prints the hedge in every state this branch renders in;
 * this note states the COST and points at the evidence rule, and the hedging stays in one place.
 *
 * ⚠ PROSE AS JSX TEXT, NOT A STRING CONSTANT — see DroppedNote below for the scanner that reads a
 * quoted string of lowercase words as a Tailwind class list.
