// The card the Docs area draws for a read it cannot serve — replacing seven fabricated pages
// and their view counts.
//
// Every sentence below requires a RESPONSE. The footnote this replaces said "the BFF serves
// only /api/docs/spaces today" while the BFF served four Docs routes; that claim could not be
// checked, so it rotted. This one cannot outlive its truth: when a Docs upstream appears, the
// probe answers 200 and the copy changes with no edit here.
// NO SESSION-EXPIRED BRANCH HERE, DELIBERATELY. One was added and then removed: this card is
// rendered ONLY inside `if (isUnconfigured(…))` — that is, only when Docs is unconfigured (503).
// A 401 never reaches it, so the branch was unreachable code that read as coverage. It was caught
// by neutralising each session branch in turn and checking SessionExpired.test.tsx went red: this
// was the one file whose removal changed nothing, anywhere.
//
// ⚠ THE SENTENCE ABOVE NAMED TWO CALLERS — "rendered by SpaceView/PageView" — AND HAS NAMED ONE
// TOO MANY SINCE W1.1.9b. The page reader dropped this card when its rebuilt headline began
// carrying the OFF state itself: a heading reading "Docs is not configured here." beside a card
// free to answer "Docs IS configured on this deployment" is two claims about ONE probe, and
// W1.1.9a had already named that drift. `SpaceView` is the only caller now, and the guarantee is
// unchanged rather than weakened — it still renders this only under `isUnconfigured`, so a 401
// still cannot arrive. Corrected in place, because a comment naming a caller it no longer has is
// how the next reader concludes a branch is reachable when it is not.
