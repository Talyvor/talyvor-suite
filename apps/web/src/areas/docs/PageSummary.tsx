// Summarise one page — the third AI control to reach a browser in this product, and the FIRST
// whose cost lands on a document rather than on the workspace at large.
//
// ── WHY THIS ONE COULD BE BUILT AND ITS FOUR SIBLINGS COULD NOT ──────────────
//
// The queue has said for weeks that "summarise / translate / shorten / lengthen / suggest-title
// all need the editor". MEASURED against talyvor-docs' own handler rather than read: they need
// the editor to put the result BACK. `POST /workspaces/{ws}/ai/transform` is text in, text out
// (`{action, text, page_id}` → `{text}`), so the READ-ONLY direction needs nothing but a page and
// somewhere to print the answer. A summary is the member of that family that is genuinely read
// rather than inserted — you do not paste a summary into the document it summarises — so it is
// the one that is finished when it is displayed. `shorter`, `longer` and `grammar` are NOT: their
// output is a replacement for the text you sent, and this app has nowhere to put a replacement
// (the only editable box here writes `content_text`, the search projection, which is an open
// product decision). That is why the BFF exposes one action of four.
//
// ── THE STATE THAT SPENDS NOTHING, AND WHY IT IS A STATE AND NOT A DISABLED BUTTON ──
//
// MEASURED upstream (tab-7b42, talyvor-docs e70ff61, scratch copy, fake Lens counting
// completions): `{"text":""}` answers **200 with a real completion of zero user bytes**, billed
// and attributed to the page. Nothing on that path refuses an empty prompt. So "there is nothing
// to summarise" is a real, reachable, MONEY-SPENDING case, and it is refused twice on purpose:
// here, where it costs not even a round trip, and again at the BFF, which is the half that holds
// when a caller is not this screen.
//
// ── WHAT IT COSTS, SAID HONESTLY OR NOT AT ALL ──────────────────────────────
//
// Unlike an ask, this operation names a page, so Docs binds Lens's request id to it and the
// charge lands on THAT page's `own_ai_cost_usd` under the feature tag `docs-ai-summarize`. The
// response carries no number and this app has no second source for one, so the sentence names
// where the charge lands and shows no figure — the same rule AskAI.tsx follows, applied to the
// opposite fact.
