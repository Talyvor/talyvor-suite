// Suggest a title for one page — the sixth AI control to reach a browser in this product, the
// third whose cost lands on a document, and the FIRST whose output is meant to be written back.
//
// ── WHY THIS ONE COULD BE BUILT WHILE SHORTER/LONGER/GRAMMAR STILL CANNOT ────
//
// PageSummary.tsx recorded the rule those three are stuck behind: their output REPLACES the text
// you sent, and the only editable box in this app writes `content_text` — the search projection
// Docs derives from the canonical document — which is an open product decision (W2.3,
// ./EDITOR-SIZING.md). Landing model output there would settle that decision sideways.
//
// A title is not in that argument at all. It is a column of its own, already in Docs'
// `updatableFields`, and this app already PATCHes it (docsApi.updatePage). So the suggestion has
// somewhere honest to land, and applying it touches nothing the editor question owns.
//
// ── TWO CLICKS, BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO DECISIONS ──────────────────────────────
//
// Suggesting SPENDS; applying CHANGES A DOCUMENT. One button doing both would make a single press
// an unreviewable spend-and-mutate, and would put a write behind the suggestion's gate rather than
// its own. So the card asks, shows, and waits.
//
// ── THE TWO MEASURED CASES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// MEASURED against talyvor-docs' own handler over a fake Lens that counts completions (tab-2f4d,
// docs f515db8, a `git archive` scratch export; that repo was held by another tab and was never
// written to):
//
//  1. A BLANK PAGE IS A MONEY CASE. `{"content":""}`, `{"content":"   \n\t  "}` and a body naming
//     no content at all are each **200 with a real billed completion** — a title invented for a
//     page the model never read. Nothing upstream refuses it. So "there is nothing to title" is a
//     state, not a disabled button, and it is refused twice: here, where it costs not even a round
//     trip, and again at the BFF, which is the half that holds when the caller is not this screen.
//
//  2. AN EMPTY SUGGESTION COMES BACK AS A 200. Engine.SuggestTitle trims ` \t\n"'` off the
//     completion and returns what is left, so a model answering `""`, `"''"` or `"\n\n"` yields
//     `{"title":""}` — five completion shapes measured, all of them. This card must not offer to
//     write that over a real title. It is NOT reported as a failure either: the completion is
//     bought by the time it arrives, and a screen calling it an error would hide a charge the
//     workspace has taken.
//
// ── WHAT IT COSTS, SAID HONESTLY OR NOT AT ALL ──────────────────────────────
//
// This operation names a page, so Docs binds Lens's request id to it and the charge lands on THAT
// page's `own_ai_cost_usd` under the feature tag `docs-ai-title`. The response carries no number
// and this app has no second source for one, so the sentence names where the charge lands and
// shows no figure — the rule AskAI.tsx and PageSummary.tsx already follow.
