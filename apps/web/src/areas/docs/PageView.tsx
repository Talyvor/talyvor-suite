//
// It used to render a fabricated ProseMirror document with a fabricated view count and
// verification date. The BFF serves the real read (/api/docs/spaces/{spaceID}/pages/{pageID});
// this deployment has no Docs upstream behind it.
//
// ⚠ `PMDoc` STAYS IN ./pm.tsx AND THIS SCREEN STILL DOES NOT RENDER IT — MEASURED, because the
// item that produced this rebuild asked a design question that turns on whether it does. The
// question was: a page-scale heading here "sits ABOVE a document that has its own h1-equivalent"
// (pm.tsx maps a stored heading of level 1 to `text-title`), so which one is the page's title?
// It does not arise. `PMDoc` has ZERO production call sites — the only file that imports it is
// its own test — so the reader below renders a `<textarea>` of `content_text`, never a document
// with headings in it. The decision recorded is therefore that there is nothing to decide YET,
// and the day someone wires the renderer in, the question is theirs and it is a real one.
//
// ⚠ AND IT IS NOT A HOLE IN A GUARD, WHICH IS THE NEXT THING TO CHECK RATHER THAN ASSUME.
// ConsoleDeepHeading.test.tsx's SOURCE census reads `<h1` literally and pm.tsx builds its tag
// by computation (`const Tag = level <= 1 ? 'h1' : …`), which is exactly the blind spot that
// file's own limits paragraph names. Its DOM sweep is what covers it, and that sweep visits this
// address — so a wired-in PMDoc rendering a stored level-1 heading would count two `<h1>`s here
// and go red. The census is blind and the sweep is not, at the one address it matters.

//
// ⚠ THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE DECISION ITS PARENT SCREEN TOOK, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS MEASURED
// RATHER THAN STYLISTIC. `SpaceView` one click up deliberately does NOT let its headline carry
// loading/empty/off/fault: the space's NAME comes from a different query (`docs-spaces`), so a
// broken page read says nothing about which space you are in, and the certain answer is available.
// Here there is no second source. The page's title arrives in the page read itself — the read that
// fails is the read that names it — so on a failure there is no certain name to fall back to, and
// a headline that pretended otherwise would be inventing one. What is certain in every state is
// WHAT HAPPENED, so that is what the largest words say.
//
// ⚠ 404 IS A STATE HERE, NOT A FAULT, AND THAT IS A SCREEN-LEVEL READING OF ONE BY-ID READ — the
// same one `areas/track/IssueDetail.tsx` already makes and documents at length, not a change to
// `lib/productState.ts` (which is right that a 404 from a COLLECTION route is a fault). MEASURED
// in the DOM before this rebuild: a 404 and a 500 at this address rendered byte-identical text —
// "Couldn’t reach Docs, so this page can’t be shown. This is a fault, not an empty page." — and
// BOTH of that sentence's clauses are false of a 404. Docs was reached. Docs answered. It is one
// predicate over four causes, which is the shape W1.1.8 removed from the ticket one directory
// over and which was still live here.
