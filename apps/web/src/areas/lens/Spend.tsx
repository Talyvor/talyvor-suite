// Spend & routing — LIVE. The screen the design system's central distinction
// was built for:
//
//   · EXACT values — µ counts straight off ledger rows — render as MuNumeral,
//     the µ-split numeral. Never rounded, never a float.
//   · DERIVED values — rates, month-USD — are ≈-marked muted captions. They
//     are estimates and they dress like estimates.
//
// THE TWO LEDGERS, kept apart (the inversion fix, same as Overview's):
// /api/tokens/history is lens_token_ledger — LENS EARNED by mining, and its
// by-model table is MINT ATTRIBUTION (copper), not provider spend. What you
// SPEND is LXC (steel): /api/lxc/history debits — a window total AND, since
// #343/#355 stamped the model and api.lxcLedger stopped discarding it, a
// per-model split of that total. ⚠ THIS PARAGRAPH SAID THE OPPOSITE — "whose
// rows carry no model attribution on any writer, so spend is shown as a window
// total, never per-model" — while the split it denied was rendering further
// down this same file. NOT every charge reaches that split, and what it
// leaves out is now disclosed rather than left to be read off the arithmetic:
// see SplitShortfall. The month card reads /api/spend/month. Only the cache card is
// still a sample: Lens exposes no workspace cache-rate endpoint, and it says
// so. Two-step TierDot only: hue is category (cheap | capable), never a rank.
