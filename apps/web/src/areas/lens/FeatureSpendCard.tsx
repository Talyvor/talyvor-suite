// Spend by feature tag — the first surface in this product that can answer the question its own
// AI cards ask a reader to go and check.
//
// ── WHY IT EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Six cards across Docs and Track end their cost sentence by NAMING a tag: "a metered Lens call
// billed to this workspace under `docs-ai-summarize`", "…under `track-search`", and so on. A tag
// is a join key; printing one is only honest if the reader can join on it. MEASURED at suite
// `fe114149` and talyvor-lens `469a255751c8a124fb132d875ecd0ca32664f88e`: Lens records the
// dimension (`token_events.feature`), Lens serves the aggregate
// (`/v1/api/spend/by-feature` → internal/api/server.go#Server.handleSpendBy), the BFF mounted
// nothing onto it, and the whole of `areas/lens` contained ZERO occurrences of the word
// `feature`. The evidence existed and the product could not show it.
//
// ── THE THREE THINGS THIS CARD SAYS OUT LOUD, EACH BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS A FALSE PICTURE ──
//
//  1. THE UNTAGGED BUCKET IS A ROW. `feature` is written from a header no caller must send, so
//     every tool a customer points at Lens off this product's Setup page lands in the empty tag.
//     Filtering it would turn a slice of a workspace's spend into a picture of all of it.
//  2. THE WINDOW IS NOT THE MONTH CARD'S. Both figures sum the same `token_events.cost_usd`
//     column (the month card's upstream is internal/tenant/store.go#monthSpendSQL), but this one
//     is a rolling `days` window and that one is calendar month-to-date. They are not expected to
//     agree; a reader who assumed they should would read the difference as a defect.
//  3. THE TAGS ARE NOT ALL OPERATION NAMES. Docs sends the operation and its own client explains
//     why a page-scoped tag would "blow up the cardinality of Lens's by-feature aggregation".
//     Track sends the ISSUE'S IDENTIFIER (`internal/ai/engine.go` passes `issue.Identifier` for
//     triage, find-duplicates and summarise), so a Track workspace gets one row per issue beside
//     the operation rows.
//
// ⚠ NO TOP-N SLICE. The whole list renders, so the order is upstream's `ORDER BY cost_usd DESC`
// and nothing here is quietly left out — a card about money that hid its tail would understate
// exactly the rows a reader came to find.
