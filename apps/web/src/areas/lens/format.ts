/**
 * Map a ledger row onto the Pill's lifecycle vocabulary, or null when the row has no
 * lifecycle and must show its own name instead.
 *
 * ⚠ THE VOCABULARY BELONGS TO ONE OF THE TWO LEDGERS, WHICH IS WHY THE TOKEN IS AN
 * ARGUMENT. settled / held / slashed describe a MINT's lifecycle — a mined LENS token's
 * state. The LXC ledger holds no mints: every row there moves a purchased balance. One
 * component renders both (Ledger.tsx takes a `token` discriminator) and it used to hand
 * this function the type WITHOUT the token, so the mint vocabulary reached LXC rows.
 *
 * MEASURED IN REAL CHROME on the real binary, one served request's actual footprint:
 * `reservation_hold` and `reservation_release` both painted **SETTLED** — the label whose
 * own definition below reads "a counted mint in circulation" — on a pre-serve BOUND that
 * Lens's writer documents as "NOT a bill" and on the credit that nets it to zero. They are
 * the most numerous rows in the ledger: a reserved request writes three and two are these.
 *
 * TWO WAYS IT GOT THERE, and neither was an enum being out of date by accident:
 *  - the movement allow-list below is a set of MINT-side spellings; `reservation_hold` and
 *    `reservation_release` were never in it;
 *  - the `*_held` suffix rule misses `reservation_hold` BY ONE LETTER, so the row did not
 *    even land on the closest wrong answer.
 * Enumerating the two would fix today and rot at the seventh LXC type. Asking WHICH LEDGER
 * cannot rot: there is no lifecycle on that side of the product to be out of date about.
 *
 * For the mint ledger nothing changes. The mapping is by SUFFIX, not an enum, so it
 * survives new mint kinds:
 *   *_held     → 'held'     (real: pattern_mine_held)  — held, but see below
 *   *_revoked  → 'slashed'  (source-defined; unexercised in the trial data)
 *   movement   → null       (plain label, no pill)
 *   otherwise  → 'settled'  (a counted mint in circulation: pattern_mine, pool_royalty…)
 *
 * Two honest gaps this encodes:
 *  - There is no 'idle' — that Pill variant was cut, because no ledger row (and no other
 *    screen) could ever produce it. See Pill.tsx.
 *  - 'held' marks the row, but the ledger exposes no hold WINDOW, so a held row can wear
 *    the Pill yet cannot drive a HoldBar. The two are decoupled on purpose.
