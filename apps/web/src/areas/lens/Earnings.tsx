// B28.10 — THIS SCREEN IS "ROYALTIES", UNDER STATEMENTS, AT /statements/royalties (/earnings
// redirects here). Sharing answers is a cost saving — repeated questions are served without paying
// a model — and a royalty is its side effect, not the product's revenue. So it sits beside the
// agents' statements rather than under Billing, says so first, and carries the LENS→LXC
// conversion, which moved here from Overview.
//
// Earnings — what this workspace has EARNED, from GET /api/earnings (the BFF proxies Lens's
// /v1/workspaces/{ws}/earnings, the workspace resolved from the session per request).
//
// ── THE OBVIOUS FIELD IS WRONG, AND IT IS ALREADY ON THIS PRODUCT'S API ───────────────────────
//
// `LensBalance.lifetime_earned_ulens` is what anyone building "your answers earned $6 back"
// reaches for. talyvor-lens #472 measured it through the production ledger on real Postgres and it
// is lifetime CREDITED, not earned: `LedgerStore.applyTx` does `earned += amount` on EVERY credit
// with no filter on the ledger type, so LENS a workspace was given, bought, or simply got back all
// raise it — 27x over what was earned on a five-row fixture. A stake/unstake round trip, which
// returns the wallet to exactly the balance it started from, raises it by the principal every
// cycle with no bound. NOTHING ON THIS SCREEN READS THAT FIELD, and earningsSource.test.ts keeps
// it that way after this comment stops being read.
//
// ── THE THREE THINGS THIS SCREEN REFUSES TO DO ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// (1) IT NEVER FOLDS CAPITAL INTO CONTRIBUTION. `stake_yield` is settled income credited to the
//     workspace, so it is real — and nobody wrote an answer for it. Adding it to the headline
//     leaves the TOTAL right and makes the SENTENCE false, which is the worse of the two.
//
// (2) IT NEVER CALLS A PEG CONVERSION A PRICE. LENS has one published peg and no market. Every
//     dollar figure says "at the published peg" and the peg is on screen, because "$6" with no
//     qualifier is a claim about what somebody would pay.
//
// (3) IT NEVER RENDERS A BARE ZERO OVER A DISABLED FEATURE. The switches a royalty needs all ship
//     OFF, so on a stock deployment the honest answer is 0 and it says nothing about the
//     workspace. When Lens reports earning is not enabled this screen names the switches instead
//     of showing a total — a "$0.00" there would state an operator setting as a measurement.

/**
 * µLENS → dollars at a published peg. EXPORTED FOR THE TEST AND NOT USED BY THE COMPONENT, which
 * is deliberate rather than an oversight.
 *
 * The screen renders the dollars LENS SENT (`*_usd_at_peg`), because two derivations of one number
 * in two repositories is how they drift. This is the INDEPENDENT one, and Earnings.test.tsx
 * asserts the two agree on the fixture — so if Lens changes the peg or the conversion, a test says
 * so rather than the screen quietly showing a figure nobody re-derived.
