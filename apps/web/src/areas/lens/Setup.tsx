// Setup — the page that was missing. A trial user signed in, minted a key, and was told nothing
// about what to do with it. The product is "point your existing tool at Lens instead of the
// provider" — two environment variables — and no screen, doc, or copy block said so.
//
// THREE THINGS THIS PAGE REFUSES TO DO, each because the alternative wastes the one thing a trial
// user has least of:
//
//  1. It does not print a base URL it cannot verify. The URL comes from /api/context's
//     lens_public_base_url, which is explicitly configured. cfg.lensBaseURL — the address the BFF
//     uses to reach Lens — is a loopback/compose address; printing it would hand every user a URL
//     that cannot resolve. Unset ⇒ this page says so and shows no snippets.
//  2. It does not fake a credential. Lens stores only a hash, so an EXISTING key's plaintext is
//     unrecoverable. Rather than print a realistic-looking placeholder, the page says why and
//     offers to mint a fresh one; the visible placeholder is deliberately not tlv_-shaped.
//  3. It does not claim a savings figure. None is measured (the README dropped its number for the
//     same reason), so the page describes the mechanism and lets the ledger show the number.
//
// TENANCY: the workspace comes from the SESSION — /api/context reads it via sessionWorkspaceID →
// a.tenantFrom(r) — and the key is minted through POST /api/keys, which the BFF scopes to that
// same session tenant. Nothing here is baked at startup; apps/bff/tenant_callsite_test.go fails
// if that regresses, and it should.

// ⚠ THE `?.` THAT USED TO BE HERE WAS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE REPO THAT ANTICIPATED AN ABSENT
// CLIPBOARD, AND IT BOUGHT A QUIETER FAILURE RATHER THAN A HANDLED ONE. It read
// `navigator.clipboard?.writeText(text).then(…)`; optional chaining short-circuits the WHOLE
// chain, so outside a secure context the `.then` was never evaluated and nothing threw — the
// button was simply inert. MEASURED in Chrome on the shipped bundle at
// `http://192.168.100.149:8791`: all FIVE copy buttons on this page clicked in turn, every
// label unchanged, and NOT ONE error raised. `RevealOnce` had no `?.` and threw instead; both
// told the reader exactly the same thing, which was nothing.
