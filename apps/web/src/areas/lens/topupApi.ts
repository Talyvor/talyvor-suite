// Live data layer for /billing — the LXC top-up path. lib/api.ts is a SHARED
// file, so (like keysApi.ts, docs/api.ts and admin/api.ts) this area's reads and
// its WRITE live here. Both routes are real and tested on the BFF
// (apps/bff/billing.go):
//
//   GET  /api/lxc/topup-options → { allowed_usd_cents }  — the amounts on offer
//   POST /api/lxc/checkout      → { url }                — a Stripe session URL
//
// THE WRITE PATH AND ORIGIN — the same argument as keysApi.ts, verified against
// apps/bff/billing.go rather than assumed: requireSameOrigin refuses a POST
// unless `Origin` equals the BFF's configured public origin. Origin is a
// forbidden header, so JS cannot and must not set it; posting to the RELATIVE
// path '/api/lxc/checkout' is same-origin, so the browser attaches it itself.
// Default credentials: 'same-origin' carries the session cookie.
//
// WHY THE AMOUNTS ARE FETCHED, NEVER HARDCODED. Lens validates the amount against
// a server-side allow-list ($10/$50/$100) and 400s anything else. A price written
// into this file would be a button that always fails the moment the two disagree,
// so the screen renders exactly what the BFF serves and nothing else. (Lens itself
// exposes that list on no endpoint — see billing.go for why the BFF holds the copy.)

 * read, #140 a create, IssueList.tsx:332 the third site, `ConvertError` the fourth) and this was

 * ⚠ LATENT, NOT LIVE, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS STATED RATHER THAN GLOSSED. The only producer is
 * `checkout` below, which TopUp.tsx calls from a useMutation — and a mutation's error never enters
 * the query cache the bar, the re-probe and the retry rule all read. So no sentence on any screen
 * was wrong. `ConvertError`'s WRITE half was latent for the same reason while its READ half was
 * the live defect; the difference between the two is one `useQuery`, which is not a property of
 * the error type. Fixed as the type it should have been rather than left for that day.
 *
 * `kind` stays: the five sentences TopUp renders are not derivable from a status alone, and the
 * `instanceof CheckoutError` at its render site is unaffected by gaining a base class. `message`
 * is kept verbatim — ApiError's constructor writes `${path} -> HTTP ${status}` and this type has
