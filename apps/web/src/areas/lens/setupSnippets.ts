// The strings a trial user pastes into a shell. Every fact here was read out of Lens source,

//
// VERIFIED against talyvor-lens@cc67661:
//
//   ROUTES (cmd/lens/main.go:1832-1835, 1869-1871, 1878-1879)
//     POST /v1/proxy/{openai,anthropic,google,bedrock,mistral,groq,vllm}/*
//     POST /oai/*  and  POST /anthropic/*
//   The last two are FIRST-CLASS routes to the same handlers (HandleOpenAI / HandleAnthropic),
//   not deprecated aliases — the source calls them "Helicone-shape URL prefixes … migrating
//   teams can keep these URLs indefinitely". They differ only in that a compat middleware
//   strips Helicone-Auth / Helicone-Property-* headers first. So /anthropic and
//   /v1/proxy/anthropic behave identically; we print the shorter one for Claude Code because
//   Claude Code appends /v1/messages and `…/anthropic/v1/messages` reads as intended.
//
//   PATH SUFFIX IS IGNORED (internal/inference/config.go:36-51)
//     upstreamURLFn returns a URL from CONFIG (openAIChatURL =
//     "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"), never something derived from the inbound
//     path. So the wildcard absorbs whatever the SDK appends. Two consequences we state
//     plainly below rather than let a user discover: only chat-completions-shaped calls work
//     (an /embeddings call would be forwarded to chat/completions), and the routes are POST
//     ONLY — no GET is registered, so a client that probes GET /models gets 405.
//
//   CREDENTIAL HEADER (internal/auth/middleware.go:35-39, 106-112)
//     extractKey reads ONLY `Authorization: Bearer …` then `X-Talyvor-Key`. AuthMiddleware
//     401s IMMEDIATELY when it comes back empty, so manager.go's broader extractor — which
//     does read X-API-Key — is never reached on these routes. This is why Claude Code must use
//     ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN (Authorization: Bearer) and NOT ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (X-Api-Key),
//     even though Anthropic's own docs call the latter the standard choice for a third-party
//     gateway. Following that advice against Lens fails with a bare 401.
