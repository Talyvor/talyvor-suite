// A THIRD DRESSING FOR A NUMBER, because this product already had exactly two and neither
// is true here.
//
//   · EXACT   — a µ count straight off ledger rows: MuNumeral, never rounded, never a float.
//   · DERIVED — a rate or a month-USD float: a ≈-marked muted caption.
//   · FLOOR   — a sum over ONE ledger page when the window holds more rows than the page.
//
// A floor rendered as an exact numeral is the most confident presentation the design system
// has, attached to the one kind of number it cannot certify. MEASURED in real Chrome against
// the real BFF binary with 260 in-window rows upstream: /spend printed `200,000 µLXC` and
// `200 charges` while the true window total was `260,000` — and two rows above, on the same
// card, the ≈-marked month figure read `≈ $0.26`, which IS 260,000 µLXC. The estimate was
// right and the exact numeral was 23% low.
//
// The mark is a word, not a new token or a new colour: the numeral keeps its face, and the
// sentence below the card says what is missing and where the whole ledger is.
