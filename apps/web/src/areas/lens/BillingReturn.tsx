// /billing/success and /billing/cancel — the URLs Lens ALREADY redirects Stripe
// back to. Its defaults are literally app.talyvor.com/billing/success?session_id=
// {CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID} and .../billing/cancel; the design assumed the suite
// owned these routes and nothing had been built at them.
//
// ── WHY THE SUCCESS PAGE POLLS AND NEVER ASSERTS ────────────────────────────
//
// Being redirected here means the PAYMENT succeeded at Stripe. It does NOT mean
// the LXC credit has landed. Those are two different events: Stripe redirects the
// browser immediately, while the credit is written when Stripe's webhook reaches
// Lens and its handler commits. The gap is normally seconds — and is unbounded if
// the webhook cannot reach this deployment at all.
//
// So a page that reads the balance once and shows it would, routinely, tell a
// paying customer their money vanished. This one instead compares against the
// balance recorded just before checkout (see topupApi.recordPendingTopUp) and
// polls until it rises, with a bounded timeout. Three consequences worth naming:
//
//   · The baseline MUST come from before the redirect. The webhook often commits
//     while the browser is still travelling, so a baseline captured on THIS page
//     would already include the credit and would never observe a change.
//   · A timeout is reported as a timeout — never as failure and never as success.
//     The money is at Stripe either way; the page says exactly that, names the
//     webhook as the thing that may not have arrived, and gives a next step.
//   · With no usable baseline the page says it cannot confirm. Showing a balance
//     and letting the customer infer would be a guess dressed as an answer.
//
// There is no way to do better from here: Lens exposes NO endpoint that resolves
// a Stripe session_id to a purchase, so the session id can be displayed as a
// support reference but cannot be looked up. The balance is the only signal.
//
// ── W1.1.4 — WHAT THIS REPLACED ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The same single anonymous card /billing had, on the two addresses a customer reaches AFTER
// paying. The reader arriving here has exactly ONE question — did my money land? — and the answer
// was written in a 17px card header while the page carried no heading of its own at all. It is
// the page-scale claim now, which is what it always was; the five states and their wording are
// unchanged, because the argument for each of them is in the header above and none of it moved.
//
// ── B28.270 — THE PAGES STOP CONTRADICTING THEMSELVES ───────────────────────
//
// Opened with no session_id — typed, bookmarked, reached from history — the success page used to
// head itself "Your payment went through." and then say it could not confirm the payment. Lens
// sends every Stripe return here WITH session_id (its default, the Helm values and the manifests
// all carry ?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}), so its absence means no checkout is returning and
// the page says exactly that. A return this browser has no record of no longer claims the payment
// in its heading, and no longer sends a subscriber hunting for a purchase row that a plan never
// writes; it points at Top up and Plans, where each kind of payment shows. The expired-session body
// no longer promises the credit "is applied either way" — that is what this page could not see.

// Exported for billingTimingContract.test.ts. MEASURED 2026-08-28 (tab-k2w8,
// W4.41): both were module-private and every one of this file's 15 tests passes
// explicit `pollIntervalMs={5} timeoutMs={400}` props, so the values a customer
// actually gets after paying were exercised by nothing. Multiplying the poll by
// 1000, and cutting the timeout from 45s to 45ms, each left the whole suite
// green — 141 files, 2067 tests.
