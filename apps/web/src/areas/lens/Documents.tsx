// distill_policy = 'always'. A customer who attaches a PDF is ALREADY having it converted, and
// nothing in the product said so. The route to turn it off — PUT /v1/workspaces/{wsID}/distill —
// has been live the whole time with nothing calling it: a setting that exists, is on, and cannot
// be reached is worse than one that was never built, because it reads as a decision nobody made.
//
// ⚠ THE SCANNED-DOCUMENT PATH IS THE PART A READER WOULD NOT GUESS. A document with no extractable
// text is sent to a VISION MODEL to be read. That is a different disclosure from "we reformat your
// file", it costs tokens rather than saving them, and it is stated plainly rather than folded into
// the sentence about savings.
//
// Structured like Sharing.tsx and for the same reason: the facts and the control live in one file
// so they cannot drift apart, and the copy states the trade rather than selling it.

 * render identically (talyvor-lens internal/api/distill_usage.go, on ErrNoDistillUsageStore). The
