// SPENDING EARNED LENS — the exit the balance did not have.
//
// A workspace earns LENS from a cross-tenant pooled royalty. Until now nothing in the suite could
// spend it: Lens had the conversion, the BFF had no code for it and no screen offered it. A balance
// with no exit is worse than no balance — it looks like money and behaves like a number.
//
// ── W1.1.3: WHAT THIS SURFACE IS, MEASURED, BECAUSE THE ITEM CALLS IT A SCREEN ──────
//
// ⚠ THERE IS NO `/convert` ROUTE AND THERE NEVER WAS. `App.tsx` declares eleven addresses and
// none of them is this one; the conversion is a surface ON the Overview screen. So the rebuild is
// the surface's, in place, and NOT a promotion to an address — a separate route is a product
// decision this file already records an argument against (the question "what can I do with this?"
// is asked while looking at the number), and reversing a recorded decision is not a session's.
//
// WHAT DID CHANGE: it was a collapsed strip at the BOTTOM OF THE LENS BALANCE CARD, under three
// lifetime rows — an irreversible money action with no name of its own, in a card about something
// else. It is now its own NAMED REGION on Overview ("02 · What you can do with it"), directly
// under the balances, so the number it is about is still on screen. That is the same screen, one
// idea per region, which is the language W1.1.1 put on this page.
//
// ── THE THREE THINGS SAID BEFORE THE BUTTON ─────────────────────────────────
//
//  1. THE RATE, read from the deployment (Lens's conversion_rate_history, which moves).
//  2. WHAT IT WILL COST, computed with the same CEIL the server uses, so the number on the button
//     is the number that will be debited rather than a friendlier one.
//  3. ⚠ THAT IT IS ONE-WAY. Lens has no LXC→LENS conversion — the function does not exist. This is
//     stated in the panel, before the click, not in a toast afterwards. A confirmation that
//     appears after an irreversible action has confirmed nothing.

/**
 * ⚠ ZERO HERE MEANS THE SERVER SAID ZERO — the caller's invariant, not this component's.
 * `Overview.tsx`'s LensCard renders this only inside its `q.data` branch, so a balance of 0 is a
 * read that LANDED and answered nothing-spendable. A FAILED read is not an empty workspace, and
 * this project has already paid twice for that conflation (a Track fault drawn identically to an
 * empty tracker; a held balance of 0 rendered beside a ledger of 822). A number prop cannot carry
 * that distinction, so it stays where it can be checked: at the call site.

  // ended on "That costs more LENS than this workspace can spend right now." Five affordances and
  // a price for a transaction that could not happen, and NO NEXT ACTION anywhere in it. That is
  // the exact shape W1.1.3 names — an absence stated without naming what to do about it.

 *    right one is the sharing choice, which is what makes reuse — and therefore earning — happen.

            amount and what becomes of it" and delegated — the held Row one region up already says
            the whole thing. IN A REAL BROWSER THAT ROW IS CLIPPED. Its hint carries `truncate`
            (`white-space:nowrap; overflow:hidden; text-overflow:ellipsis`), and at 1280 with the
            sidebar it measured clientWidth 337 against scrollWidth 449 — 112px, a quarter of the
            sentence, cut. What was cut is the tail: "during which it can still be revoked". The
            reader saw "settles on its own after a holding period — during which i…".
            ⚠ AND NO TEST IN THIS REPO COULD SEE THAT. `ClaimsAudit.test.tsx` and `Held.test.tsx`
            both assert the tail is PRESENT, and both assert on textContent under jsdom, which has
            no layout: they were green on a sentence nobody could read.
            ⚠ FIXED IN W1.1.12 — `Row`'s hint wraps, and the sentence is fully visible at
            1440/1280/1024/390. THIS PARAGRAPH IS CORRECTED RATHER THAN DELETED because the
            argument it makes is still the reason this branch states the mechanism instead of
            delegating: a second voice earned by a measurement does not stop being earned when
            the first voice becomes readable, and deleting it here would quietly re-open the
            question of which region owns the fact. It WAS the only clipped `.truncate` on this
            screen (measured at 1280 and at 1920 — the measure is capped at max-w-5xl, so widening
            the window did not uncut it). The Row belongs to the shared `@talyvor/ui` and fixing
            it there reaches every screen in the product, so it was REPORTED as its own queue item
            and not smuggled into this one — W1.1.12, now merged. At the time, a delegation to a
            sentence measured as unreadable would have been a false sentence, so this branch did
            not delegate; it still does not, for the reason above.
            ⚠ WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT REPEAT IS THE FIGURE. A first draft rendered the held amount
            a second time and `Held.test.tsx`'s "does not fold held into the spendable balance"
            went red on `getAllByText(/822/).length` — a guard written against a SUMMED headline,
            catching a DUPLICATED one. It was right both times. */}
