// Members — the workspace roster, LIVE from GET /api/members (the BFF proxies Track's
// /v1/workspaces/{ws}/members, the workspace resolved from the session per request, the session
// email sent as the membership join key).
//
// This screen used to render two invented people under a caption that already said the route
// had landed. It had: apps/bff/lens.go registers /api/members. Nothing called it.
//
// Track is an OPTIONAL upstream and is not deployed here, so the route answers 503 today. That
// state is DETECTED from the response, not written into this file — see lib/productState.ts
// for why a hardcoded "not configured" would just become the next stale caption. When the
// TRACK_* pair appears, this screen starts showing the real roster with no change here.
//
// Rows mirror Track's memberView exactly: {id, name, email, role, avatar_url}, roles
// owner | member. Owner sorts first; the distinction is WEIGHT, not a hue — role text is a
// category label, and text is never a hue.
//
// ── W1.1.6 — THE REBUILD, AND THE THREE THINGS MEASUREMENT CHANGED ──────────────────────────
//
// (1) IT WAS ONE ANONYMOUS CARD. Measured against the real `<App/>` at `80825e12`: /members
// rendered ZERO `<section>` landmarks, zero region labels and no page-scale heading, beside
// /keys (rebuilt under W1.1.5) at three of each. A reader moving by region got one stop on the
// screen that says who can reach this workspace. It is three named regions now.
//
// (2) ⚠⚠ THE EMPTY STATE WAS COPY FOR A STATE THAT CANNOT OCCUR. The branch said "No members in
// this workspace yet … a person appears here when they are added to this workspace in Track."
// MEASURED against a real Postgres with talyvor-track's 26 real migrations applied, its REAL
// authz.Middleware, its REAL MgmtHandler.List and its REAL member.Store (read-only `git archive`
// export at track `af7e08a`; that repo was held by another tab and was never written to):
// authz authorizes from `SELECT workspace_id, id, role FROM members WHERE email = $1` and List
// reads `SELECT … FROM members WHERE workspace_id = $1` — THE SAME TABLE. So an authorized
// caller is always in their own result set: 200 carried the caller's row, a non-member got 403,
// and deleting the caller's row got 403 rather than an empty 200. With the gate bypassed the
// same handler DID answer `[]`, which is how we know the instrument could have found otherwise.
// The branch survives — deleting it would render nothing at all if that ever changed — but it
// now says what the state would MEAN, which is that two things disagree.
//
// (3) ⚠ THE PROVENANCE LINE STATED A PINNING THIS BFF REFUSES TO BOOT WITH. It read "the
// workspace is pinned server-side". `TRACK_WORKSPACE_ID` is gone and apps/bff/main.go:138
// refuses the boot if it is set — "leaving it set would state a pinning that does not happen". The
// workspace comes from the SESSION per request (apps/bff/track_tenant.go), and a browser-named
// one is ignored (apps/bff/keys_test.go:318). That is what the line says now, and it is the
// half a reader actually needs: the browser cannot choose whose roster this is.

const HEADLINE = 'Everyone who can reach this workspace.'
const HEADLINE_UNCONFIGURED = 'This deployment runs no Track, so it has no roster.'
const HEADLINE_CONTRADICTION = 'The roster came back with nobody in it.'
// ⚠ A FAILED READ GETS ITS OWN, and the reason is the one this screen already applies to the
// provenance line. "Everyone who can reach this workspace." is a claim ABOUT A ROSTER, and under a
// failed read there is no roster to be about — the reader would have to get past a page-scale
// sentence describing a list before reaching the card that says the list is missing.
const HEADLINE_FAILED = 'The roster could not be read.'

/**
 * The membership join key, compared the way the upstream compared it.
 *
 * The BFF sends `X-User-Email: sess.email` and calls it "the workspace-membership join key"
 * (apps/bff/lens.go:1152); /auth/me serves that SAME `s.email` (apps/bff/auth.go:835); Track
 * authorizes and lists from `members.email` with SQL `=`.
 *
 * ⚠ SO THE COMPARISON IS EXACT, DELIBERATELY. Case-folding here would be a DIFFERENT rule from
 * the one that produced the row, and it would mark a row the upstream did not match — a claim
 * about who you are, made by the browser, on the screen whose whole subject is identity. Track's
 * `members` table has UNIQUE (workspace_id, email), so at most one row can match; there is no
 * ambiguity to resolve by being clever.
