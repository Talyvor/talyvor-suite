// Overview: the first screen a trial user sees. It answers, in order:
//   1. What have I got?            — the two balances (live).
//   2. What am I spending — and what am I earning? — the TWO token economies,
//      plainly separated and wearing their own metals: LXC debits (steel; the
//      lxc_ledger is what inference SPENDS) + month ≈USD, then LENS mint
//      attribution by model (copper; lens_token_ledger is what mining EARNS).
//   3. Is the cache earning me anything? — the product's claim, on MEASURED
//      numbers from /api/usage (Lens serve_source). This was a fixture reading
//      1,240 serves at 87% under a caption explaining that no endpoint served
//      it; the endpoint existed all along. See CacheCard.tsx.
//   4. Is anything wrong?          — the products strip. An unconfigured
//                                    product (BFF 503) reads as calm state,
//                                    never as an error.
//   5. What just happened?         — recent ledger activity, last and small.
//
// Density is the idiom: settings rows, not billboards. One 200-row history
// fetch feeds both the by-model table and recent activity (react-query dedupes
// on the shared key). Numbers: exact µ counts are MuNumerals; anything derived
// (month USD, hit rate) is a ≈-marked muted caption; plain counts are mono ink.

// the same page, or the "at least" mark describes a number it is not attached to.

              real royalty was 822 µLENS held against a spendable balance of 0 — correct, and
              unreadable: the screen showed one number and the ledger showed another.

              Counting held in the headline would overstate what can be spent, and the conversion
              would then refuse an amount the user had just been shown. Omitting it loses money
              they earned. So it is its own row, labelled, and rendered ONLY when there is some —
              a permanent "Held 0" would be noise on every workspace that never earns a royalty.

              ⚠ THE HINT CARRIED TWO ERRORS OF THE SAME CLASS, both corrected here.
              (1) It said "about 72h". That is LENS_POOL_HOLDBACK_WINDOW — an operator setting,
                  which Lens publishes on NO endpoint. This screen therefore cannot read it and
                  was printing a figure it had no way to verify; on a deployment configured
                  differently it was simply wrong. Terms explicitly promises that this screen
                  "reflects how this deployment is currently configured", which a hardcoded
                  constant cannot do.
              (2) It said only that held LENS SETTLES. During the window it can also be REVOKED
                  (mining.RevokeHeldTx burns it) — that is what the window is FOR. Saying the
                  settlement and omitting the reversal is the pleasant half of the mechanism,
                  and Terms already states both, so this row contradicted it by omission. */}

//
// THE INVERSION THIS FIXES: /api/tokens/history reads lens_token_ledger — LENS
// EARNED by pattern mining. /api/lxc/history reads lxc_ledger — LXC SPENT on
// inference. The first version of this card presented mint attribution labelled
// as spend. Now each economy wears its own metal: steel (lxc) for what left the
// balance, copper (lens) for what mining credited.
//
// THE LXC LEDGER SPLITS PER MODEL AND THE MINT LEDGER DOES NOT. LXC rows carry
// requested_model on every agent-lane writer (#343) plus served_model on the
// delivered-charge row (#355). This card used to say per-model LXC spend was "not
// derivable" — true at lens 8c70d9e, false from #343, and it survived because
// api.lxcLedger discarded the field so nothing could contradict it.
//
// ⚠ THE SENTENCE HERE USED TO CLAIM THE SAME OF THE MINT LEDGER — "LENS mint rows carry
// metadata.model_used" — AND THAT WAS NEVER MEASURED. Every settled mint row is written by
// one of two sweepers, whose metadata maps are literals: traffic_holds.go:181
// {"request_id", "traffic_hold"} and poolroyalty/sweeper.go:257 {"request_id"}. Neither
// names a model. The one lens_token_ledger writer that does (pattern_mining.go:486) stamps
// it on the HELD row of an earning stage COORDINATION.md records as not switched on. So
// `byModel` is empty over every window this product can produce, and the empty state below
// says so instead of reporting it as an empty ledger. See mintAttribution.test.tsx.
// The two splits are kept in SEPARATE sections and never summed: µLXC charged to the
// workspace is not provider USD COGS.

/* ── The screen ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
//
// W1.1.1 — WHAT THIS REPLACED. Six cards in a two-column grid, `max-w-3xl`, no heading of the
// screen's own and no label above any group of them. The sticky banner wrote "Overview" and
// everything below it was one undifferentiated run of panels — so the five questions this file's
// header says the screen answers "in order" were answered in an order nothing on the page stated.
// The empty state was six zeros with no next action above the fold.
//
// The language is the PUBLIC SITE's, in the console's type scale — the same port `6aecb0d` made
// of the palette and the faces, applied to a layout for the first time:
//
//   · the section marking from areas/marketing/Landing.tsx §SectionLabel — a 2px accent tick
//     (colour on a tick, never on text), a mono index, one uppercase eyebrow;
//   · ONE page-scale heading. `text-title` is the top of the console ramp (24px) and the
//     marketing display steps stop at the gate (displayScale.test.ts), so it is the largest type
//     a console screen may write — and it had never been written on this one;
//   · air between regions rather than a gutter between cards: a section is one idea, and the
//     rule under it is where that idea ends.
//
// ⚠ EVERY REGION IS A NAMED LANDMARK, which is the half of the marking that is not decoration.
// The screen used to be one `main` containing six anonymous panels; a reader moving by region got
// one stop. Six now, each named by the question it answers.

// The region marking and the screen wrapper now live in components/Region.tsx — they landed here
// with this screen and moved out the moment W1.1.2 wanted the same shape. Two copies of a marking
// are how a language stops being one.

// The two headlines. Written out here rather than inline so the screen's one page-scale claim is
// readable in one place, and so the first-run wording cannot drift from the predicate below it.
