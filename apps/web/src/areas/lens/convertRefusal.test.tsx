/**
 * THE CONVERT PANEL TOLD A PERSON TO RETRY A REQUEST THAT IS REFUSED FOREVER.
 *
 * `classify()` in convertApi.ts routes 402→insufficient, 400→too_small, 404/503→unavailable and
 * EVERYTHING ELSE — 401 included — into `upstream`, whose sentence ends "Please try again."
 * MEASURED on the rendered panel at `3ba7a63`, workspace token refused upstream: the panel read
 *
 *     "Couldn’t convert — nothing was converted. Please try again."
 *
 * A 401 is a verdict, not a flake. The same request will be refused until the person signs in
 * again, so "Please try again" is not merely unhelpful — it is false, and it is false on the one
 * screen that spends money. IssueList.tsx makes exactly this argument for its own 4xx refusal
 * ("the same request will be refused forever, so 'Try again' is not merely unhelpful, it is
 * false") and the sibling money path already solved it: `CheckoutError` carries a `signed_out`
 * kind reading "Your session has expired. Sign in again, then choose an amount — nothing was
 * charged." Conversion had no such kind.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE HAND-ROLLED TYPE TURNED THREE SHARED MECHANISMS OFF WITHOUT TOUCHING ONE OF THEM.
 * `ConvertError extends Error`, and every session-expiry mechanism in this app keys on
 * `instanceof ApiError`:
 *
 *   MEASURED at `3ba7a63`, on a ConvertError built from a 401:
 *     isSessionExpired(e)                          false   → the app-wide bar stays hidden
 *     e instanceof ApiError                        false   → QueryCache.onError never re-probes
 *     App.tsx retry(0, e)                          TRUE    → the app RETRIES a 401
 *     ...for the same 401 as an ApiError, retry()  false
 *
 * IssueList.tsx:332 wrote that hazard down in this repo, at its third site: "a hand-rolled error
 * type turns the shared predicate off without one line of the predicate changing — #136 for a
 * read, #140 for the create four lines above, and this was the third site." The convert quote is
 * the fourth, and it is a READ IN THE QUERY CACHE — which is the store `useSessionExpired`
 * subscribes to, so it is the one that could have raised the bar and did not.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THE QUOTE AND THE CONVERT GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS, from this repo's own rule. The bar
 * "can see that all of them failed for the same reason" and a panel "knows only that its own
 * request failed". The QUOTE is a useQuery — it lands in the cache the bar reads, so the bar
 * speaks and the panel must fall silent rather than add a second, differently-worded diagnosis
 * (TrackArea.tsx states that rule; SessionExpiredBar.tsx records failing it once already). The
 * CONVERT is a useMutation — `cache.getAll()` never sees it, so no bar can ever appear for it
 * and the panel is the only thing in a position to speak. Two different answers, one rule.
 *
 * ⚠ THE 401 BRANCH MUST NOT BECOME A CATCH-ALL. "A change that makes 401 honest by routing 500
 * to the same message has not fixed anything, it has just moved which failures are misdescribed"
 * — SessionExpired.test.tsx's own words. Group D holds the other four kinds still, and asserts
 * that a 500 KEEPS "Please try again", because on a genuine fault retrying is true advice.
