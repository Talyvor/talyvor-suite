// Members WAS fixture-backed: two invented people ("Sample Owner", "Sample Member") under a
// caption that already admitted "GET /api/members landed with the shared-unblock PR". The
// route did exist — apps/bff/lens.go registers it — and this screen simply never called it.
//
// It is a TRACK upstream, and this deployment runs no Track (no TRACK_* variables, the
// service is not in the compose stack), so /api/members answers 503 here. That is exactly
// why the not-configured state must be DETECTED from the response rather than written into
// the screen: hardcoding "Track isn't configured" would become the next stale caption the
// day Track ships. The screen asks, and reports what it finds.
//
// ── W1.1.6 — WHAT THE REBUILD CHANGED, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT DECIDED IT ───────────────────
//
// The screen was ONE anonymous card: zero `<section>` landmarks, no heading of its own, and its
// only page-scale claim was a card header reading "Members". Measured against the real `<App/>`
// at `80825e12`, /members rendered `sections: 0, regionLabels: [], text-title: []` beside /keys
// (rebuilt under W1.1.5) at `sections: 3, regionLabels: 3, text-title: 1`.
//
// ⚠⚠ AND ITS EMPTY STATE WAS COPY FOR A STATE THAT CANNOT HAPPEN. The old branch said "No members
// in this workspace yet … a person appears here when they are added to this workspace in Track."
// MEASURED against a real Postgres with talyvor-track's 26 real migrations, its REAL
// authz.Middleware, its REAL MgmtHandler.List and its REAL member.Store (read-only `git archive`
// export at track `af7e08a`; that repo was held by another tab and was never written to):
//
//   P1  authorized caller           → 200 with the CALLER'S OWN ROW. Never [].
//   P2  authz gate BYPASSED         → 200 [] — so the handler CAN answer empty; P1 is the GATE.
//   P3  member of another workspace → 403 WORKSPACE_FORBIDDEN, never 200 [].
//   P4  caller's own row DELETED    → 403 WORKSPACE_FORBIDDEN, never 200 [].
//   P5  wire body                   → a JSON array; Track never sends `null` on this route.
//
// authz.Middleware authorizes from `SELECT workspace_id, id, role FROM members WHERE email = $1`
// and List reads `SELECT … FROM members WHERE workspace_id = $1` — the SAME TABLE. An authorized
// caller is therefore in their own result set, and a 200 with nobody in it is a CONTRADICTION
// rather than a new workspace. The branch stays (deleting it would render nothing at all if that
// ever changed) and now says what the state would MEAN, which is that something is wrong.
//
// ⚠ THE STATE A NEW SIGNUP ACTUALLY SEES FIRST ON THIS DEPLOYMENT IS THE 503, and that is where
// the "name the next action" half of W1.1.6 lands: the two variables, measured from
// apps/bff/main.go:263-260, not remembered.
