// Sharing.tsx — cross-tenant answer sharing: the explanation, and the control.
//
// ONE FILE ON PURPOSE. The signup prompt and the settings control describe the same thing and
// write to the same endpoint. Kept apart they drift, and the first draft of the signup screen
// already shipped a claim the product could not honour ("you can change this later in settings"
// — there was no settings screen). A claim about CONSENT is the worst kind to let go stale, so
// the words and the control live together and are used by both screens.
//
// THE COPY STATES BOTH SIDES AND SELLS NEITHER. Sharing is what makes the earning half of the
// product work: this workspace's answers earn LENS when another company reuses them, and it is
// served instantly from theirs. It is also a real disclosure: the content of answers leaves the
// workspace. Both facts are load-bearing, so both are stated, in parallel structure and with the
// same weight. No recommendation, no default-highlighted button, no language that makes one
// option feel like the sensible one. A consent screen that sells is worse than one that only
// warns — the person has to be able to read it and decide.
//
// B28.10 — SAVINGS FIRST, EARNINGS LAST. Sharing is a cost saving: a repeated question is served
// from an answer another company already paid for. The royalty a shared answer earns is a side
// effect, so it is the last line on the "on" side and is called a royalty, not the point. The
// disclosure stays exactly where it was, beside the saving, with the same weight.
//
// This matters more since sharing became ON by default: the screen is now the only thing standing
// between a person and disclosure, so it has to be readable by someone who is not looking for it.
