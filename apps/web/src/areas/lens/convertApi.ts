// The LENS → LXC conversion, client side.
//
// Two endpoints, both added in apps/bff/convert.go and both session-scoped there — the workspace
// is never named by this code because it cannot be:
//
//   GET  /api/lens/convert-quote → { lens_per_lxc, usd_per_lxc, min_lxc_ulxc, reversible, … }
//   POST /api/lens/convert       → ConvertResult (both new balances)
//
// ⚠ THE QUOTE IS FETCHED, NOT COMPUTED. The rate lives in Lens's conversion_rate_history and
// changes; a number baked into this bundle would be a stale claim on a money screen the first time
// it moved. Same reason the top-up amounts are read rather than hardcoded.
//
// ⚠ AND THE CONVERSION IS ONE-WAY. Lens has no LXC→LENS path at all — not a flag that is off, the
// function does not exist. The screen must say that BEFORE the button, which is why `reversible`
// and its note travel with the quote rather than being written into a component.

 * Every session-expiry mechanism in this app keys on `instanceof ApiError`: `isSessionExpired`,
 * `useSessionExpired`'s scan of the query cache, App.tsx's "a 401 is a verdict, not a flake"
 * retry rule, and the QueryCache.onError gate re-probe. A hand-rolled Error subclass turns all
 * four off without one line of any of them changing — IssueList.tsx:332 recorded that hazard in
 * this repo at its third site (#136 a read, #140 a create). The convert QUOTE was the fourth,
 * and the only one that is a `useQuery`: it lands in the very cache the bar subscribes to, so it
 * was the one that could have raised the bar and did not. MEASURED at `3ba7a63`: the app issued
 * a SECOND refused quote request on a 401, because the retry predicate could not see it.
 *
 * `kind` stays, because the panel's five sentences are not derivable from a status alone, and
 * `instanceof ConvertError` at the two render sites is unaffected by gaining a base class.
