// HELD LENS, ASSERTED AS THE TESTER SAW IT.
//
// ⚠ THE INCIDENT. The first pool royalty ever minted was 822 µLENS with type pool_royalty_held.
// lens_token_ledger said 822, pool_royalty_mints said 822, and the Overview LENS balance said 0.
// The 0 was CORRECT — a held mint credits held_balance and only becomes spendable when Lens's
// finalize sweeper settles it after the holdback window (72h by default). A correct system that
// explains nothing reads as a broken one, and the tester's reaction was "this is weird".
//
// Held is NOT spendable and NOT lost. Three states; the screen showed one.

// query response would pass on a screen that dropped the number on the floor.

// the 30-day window of the fixtures below, which is the only property any assertion here needs.
