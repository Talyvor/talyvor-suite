// /billing — buying LXC. Until this screen there was no way for a customer to do
// it at all: the Lens half (checkout, a signature-verified webhook, exactly-once
// crediting) has been complete for a while, but nothing in the suite ever called
// it, and Lens's success redirect already pointed at routes that did not exist.
//
// The flow, and where the money actually is at each step:
//   1. Click an amount → POST /api/lxc/checkout. NOTHING is charged yet.
//   2. The browser goes to Stripe. The payment happens THERE, not here.
//   3. Stripe redirects to /billing/success — see BillingReturn.tsx. The LXC
//      credit lands separately, when Stripe's webhook reaches Lens.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS SCREEN REFUSES TO DO:
//
//   · Hardcode a price. The amounts are an allow-list enforced server-side; a
//     price written here would become a button that always fails the moment the
//     lists disagree. They are fetched, and only what the server returns is drawn.
//
//   · Fail silently. Every way this can break — billing switched off on the
//     deployment, an expired session, a rejected origin, an unreachable Lens,
//     an allow-list mismatch — arrives as its own sentence with its own next
//     step. A top-up page about to ask for money that just greys out is worse
//     than no page at all.
//
// One thing it deliberately does NOT do: pre-flight whether billing is enabled.
// Lens only reveals that by 404-ing the checkout route, and the only way to ask
// is to POST — which, with a valid amount, would create a real Stripe session as
// a side effect. So the buttons are shown, and a first click on a deployment
// without billing explains itself immediately and exactly.
//
// ── W1.1.4 — WHAT THIS REPLACED ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE card in a `max-w-3xl` stack, holding four different ideas: what you have, what you can buy,
// what went wrong, and what happens after you pay. No heading of the screen's own — the sticky
// banner wrote "Billing" and everything under it was one anonymous panel — and no marking between
// the four. A reader moving by region got exactly one stop on the page where this product takes
// money.
//
// The language is the public site's, in the console's type scale, via components/Region.tsx: a
// 2px accent tick, a mono index, one uppercase eyebrow per region, ONE page-scale heading, and air
// between regions rather than a gutter between cards. Same shape W1.1.1 put on Overview and
// W1.1.2 on Setup — this screen is the fourth to get it, not a fourth version of it.

// construction and lets the first click say otherwise.
// ⚠ THE FOURTH ONE IS THE STATE THAT ACTUALLY SHIPS, and it exists because the first draft had
// only three: a deployment with billing off drew HEADLINE_CANNOT_SELL and the "you have none"
// half was lost. Billing is OFF by default and a new workspace holds nothing, so billingOff AND

 * paid twice for that conflation (a Track fault drawn identically to an empty tracker; a held
 * balance of 0 rendered beside a ledger of 822). Told wrongly HERE it announces to a paying
 * customer, on the money screen, that their credit is gone.
 *
 * ⚠ IT READS ONE FIELD, AND THE OMISSION IS DELIBERATE. Overview's first run also requires
 * `lifetime_minted_ulxc === 0`, which would separate "never had any" from "spent it all". This
 * screen does not make that distinction, for two reasons: the NEXT ACTION is identical either
 * way, and the field's meaning — whether a card purchase counts as minting — is defined in
 * talyvor-lens, which was held by another session and which I did not read. So the copy is
 * written to be true of both ("has no LXC", not "has never had any") rather than resting on a

 * sentence here claims one is refused: that is an upstream behaviour and this screen has never
 * read it.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE SECOND STEP IS CONDITIONAL BECAUSE THE CAPABILITY IS. Converting needs LENS this
 * workspace has EARNED (`ConvertLens` renders a nothing-to-spend branch otherwise), so the step

                              (`Cents`), so the call-site scan reads it as a money render and the
                              nearest face was the plain flex div. The rule is deliberately broad —
                              this file says narrowing a detector until its false positives vanish
                              is how it stops finding the real ones — so the call moved to where the
                              value is actually rendered rather than the rule moving. */}
