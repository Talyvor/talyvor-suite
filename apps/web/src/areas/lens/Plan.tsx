/**
 * B1.6 — a subscriber's plan, on /billing under the LXC balance: what it costs, what the team's
 * answers earned back against it, and how much of this period's allowance is used and left.
 *
 * ⚠ IT DRAWS NOTHING UNLESS THERE IS A PLAN TO DESCRIBE. No plans sold here (`enabled:false`),
 * not subscribed (`allowance: null`), still loading, or a read that failed — none of those is a
 * sentence about a plan, and a card saying "no plan" to a workspace whose read merely failed would
 * be the conflation this app has paid for twice. A failed read draws nothing rather than a claim;
 * the balance card above already reports an unreachable Lens.
 *
 * B26.17 — and whether it renews or ends, and when, with cancelling at the end of the period or
 * resuming it before then (PlanRenewal, the same control /plans draws).
 *
 * B27.20 — the allowance row follows that answer: a cancelled plan's allowance ends and is never
 * said to renew, and while the answer is unknown the row promises neither.
