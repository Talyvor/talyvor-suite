// API keys — LIVE. This screen exists because of one real failure: Lens's mint
// response returns `key` and `prefix` ADJACENT in one line of JSON, they look
// nearly identical, and the wrong one got copied — ten minutes of "invalid API
// key". The design makes that mistake structurally impossible:
//
//   · The CREDENTIAL appears exactly once, in a RevealOnce card, with one
//     primary action — Copy key — that copies the key and nothing else. On
//     dismissal it leaves the DOM and the mutation cache; there is no way back.
//   · The PREFIX never sits beside the key at equal weight — a labeled,
//     separated "not a credential" block — and in the list rows, where a
//     credential never appears at all.
//
// WIRED to the real BFF routes (apps/bff/keys.go), which hold the workspace key
// server-side:
//   GET  /api/keys → list (WorkspaceAPIKey rows, no credential)
//   POST /api/keys → mint (201 {key, prefix, …}; key shown once). The POST is a
//     write, guarded by the BFF's Origin check — satisfied automatically because
//     keysApi.mint posts to a same-origin relative path (see keysApi.ts).
//
// ── W1.1.5 — WHAT THIS REPLACED ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ONE card holding four different ideas — where to learn what a key is FOR, how to mint one, what
// went wrong, and the keys that exist — with no heading of the screen's own and no marking between
// them. The sticky banner wrote "Keys" and everything under it was one anonymous panel, so a reader
// moving by region got exactly one stop on the screen that hands out credentials and revokes them.
//
// ⚠ AND ITS EMPTY STATE WAS A ROW IN A LIST. "No keys yet. Create one above." is a sentence about
// the LIST. The state a new signup is in is a WORKSPACE with no credential at all, and the thing
// that state most needs said — that a key on its own does nothing until a tool is pointed at Lens
// — was a caption in the corner of the card. It is the screen's own state now, at page scale, with
// the two steps that end it. The list-level sentence is GONE rather than kept beside it: naming
// one absence twice is what W1.1.4 found on /billing one directory over.
//
// The region marking is components/Region.tsx's, shared with Overview, Setup and Billing.
/**
 * KeyRow — one key, with the way to destroy it.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THE CONFIRM IS FOR, ARGUED. The obvious confirm is "Are you sure?", and it guards the
 * wrong thing. Nobody revokes a key by accidentally pressing a button they did not mean to press;
 * they revoke THE WRONG KEY. This list makes that easy — every identifier is tlv_ws_ + eight hex,
 * they are the same length and shape, and names repeat because people call three of them "CI
 * pipeline". A yes/no dialog confirms the ACT, which was never in doubt, and says nothing about the
 * TARGET, which is the only thing that can go wrong.
 *
 * So the confirm is to type the identifier of the key being revoked. It cannot be satisfied without
 * looking at the row, and it fails closed against the specific mistake — reaching for the wrong row
 * — that a yes/no dialog waves straight through. It is the same standard used for deleting a
 * repository or a database, for the same reason: irreversible, and the damage is silent.
 *
 * The cost is real: cleaning up three dead keys means typing three identifiers. That is accepted
 * deliberately. The dangerous case is revoking a LIVE key by mistake, and that is exactly the case
 * that should be slow.
