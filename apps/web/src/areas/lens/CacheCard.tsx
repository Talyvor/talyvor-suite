// The cache panel — the product's central claim, on MEASURED numbers.
//
// ── WHAT THIS REPLACES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Both screens used to render a fixture: 1,240 cached serves, an 87% hit rate, 1,421 lookups,
// under a caption explaining that no Lens endpoint served this. The endpoint existed the
// whole time — GET /v1/api/usage, described in Lens's own source as "per-model usage +
// serve_source cache hit rate (trial core), one call", and its doc comment names this very
// card as the consumer. Nothing in the suite had ever called it. On a real trial workspace
// the numbers are single digits.
//
// ── THE THREE STATES, AND WHY THE EMPTY ONE IS NOT 0% ────────────────────────
//
//   loading   → "Loading…"
//   error     → "Couldn't load the cache rate." A number would be a guess wearing a
//               measurement's clothes; this is the one thing the panel must never do.
//   no rows   → "No requests recorded in this window yet." NOT 0%. A zero rate is a real
//               measurement meaning "the cache never hit"; with an empty denominator there
//               is nothing measured at all, and printing 0% would assert the cache is
//               failing. This is the same reasoning that made Lens abandon its `cached`
//               boolean: nothing wrote it true, so its rate was a structural zero reported
//               as a measurement.
//   measured  → hits as an exact count (figure face, ink), rate as a ≈-marked derived caption,
//               and the DENOMINATOR always beside it — a rate without its sample size is
//               not a reading.
//
// The `days` window is passed to Lens, so the number matches whatever window the screen
// claims in its caption rather than silently always being 30.
