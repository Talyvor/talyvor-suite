// THE CHAT SCREEN — W4.6.1 step 6. The first surface that puts Model 2 in front of a person.
//
// Steps 3 and 4 built the whole lane: `apps/bff/stream.go` relays POST
// /api/ai/stream/{provider}/{rest...} to Lens's streaming proxy, flushing after every chunk, on a
// client with no whole-exchange timeout, using a {proxy}-scoped SESSION key it mints and leases
// server-side. ⚠ SO THE BROWSER NEVER HOLDS A WORKSPACE KEY, which is the reason step 4 exists.
//
// ── WHAT THIS SCREEN CLAIMS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO CLAIM ────────────────────
//
// ⚠ EVERY PROVIDER LENS STREAMS, AND ONLY THE ONES THIS DEPLOYMENT HOLDS A KEY FOR (B18.58). Lens
// streams each provider through its own upstream (B18.7), so the picker offers every provider it
// proxies — minus those Lens answers 503 "not configured" for, which the BFF's /api/ai/providers
// names. The picker STATES how many catalog entries that hid. A count a reader can see is the
// difference between a narrowed list and a false one.
//
// ⚠ THE LIST COMES FROM THE DEPLOYMENT, NOT FROM THIS FILE. `/api/models` proxies Lens's
// `/v1/catalog/models`. A hardcoded model list is the exact shape this project keeps finding — a
// front end documenting a set the server does not have.
//
// ⚠ NOTHING HERE CLAIMS THE CONVERSATION IS BILLED. Measured in talyvor-lens and merged as
// `dd1bb44` (W4.6.1 step 4b): in the default configuration a SESSION-KEY request moves no LXC at
// all — serve()'s entire LXC admission-and-debit block sits inside `if agentKeyID != ""`, and a
// session key carries no APIKeyID by design. This screen therefore shows a model's LIST PRICE, which
// is a fact about the catalog, and says nothing about what the workspace was charged, which would
// be a claim about a ledger that did not move.
//
// B28.354 — a conversation can name an agent to pay for it ("Paid by", ./PaidBy.tsx). Its requests then carry
// that agent to Lens, and an answer says the agent paid only when Lens's answer names the agent it billed.
//
// ⚠ HISTORY LIVES IN THIS BROWSER (B1.3), NOT ON A SERVER. Lens's migration 0009 states
// "prompt/response text is intentionally NOT stored in DB (privacy)", and a server-side history
// would reverse that for every workspace. ./history.ts keeps conversations in localStorage, scoped
// to the signed-in identity, and the screen says where they are kept.
//
// ── B10.3: THE LAYOUT PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW ────────────────────────────────────
//
// A collapsible rail (New chat, conversations newest first, B32.53's rooms, the how-to link), one centred reading
// column, and a composer pinned to the bottom with the model picker inside it. Replies render as
// Markdown. Explanations live on /chat/help (./ChatHelp.tsx), not on this screen; what stays here
// is what a reader needs at the moment of reading — a price, a failure, where history is kept.
//
// ── B29.10: IN THE BRAND ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// As minimal as before, on the board's planes: the composer on `raised` with a line-strong border and
// the teal Send as the view's one primary action, the model picker in the eyebrow style, questions and
// replies in Space Grotesk 15/24 with code and numbers in IBM Plex Mono, and the wallet lines a spend
// answer reads in the wallet screens' raised card.
