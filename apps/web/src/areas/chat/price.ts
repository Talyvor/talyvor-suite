/**
 * price.ts — rendering a CATALOG LIST RATE (USD per 1M tokens) as money.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THIS IS NOT `formatCost` FROM ../track/format. That is this app's house money formatter and
 * it is the obvious thing to reach for. It is CORRECT for what it was written for — actual spend in
 * dollars, where two decimals is the money boundary — and WRONG here. Its branch is
 * `usd < 0.01 ? toFixed(4) : toFixed(2)`, and the cheapest seeded catalog rate is **0.015**
 * (internal/catalog/seed.go, the smallest InputPer1M of 45 entries). 0.015 is not below 0.01, so it
 * takes the two-decimal branch and renders **`$0.01`** — a real price corrupted by a third.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT ROUNDS DOWN, WHICH IS NOT WHAT "round half up" PREDICTS. 0.015 has no exact double; it
 * is stored as 0.014999999999999999445, so toFixed(2) is correctly rounding a value BELOW the
 * midpoint. This product's rule elsewhere is that charges CEIL — this silently floors, on the
 * cheapest model in the catalog. A per-1M rate lives in the gap between that formatter's two cases.
 * price.test.ts pins the measured value as a control so the reason survives the next person who
 * notices the duplication.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE, MEASURED IN THE DOM RATHER THAN READ FROM THE SOURCE:
 *
 *     List price · 2.5 in / 10 out per 1M tokens
 *
 * No currency mark anywhere, on the one screen whose product thesis is showing what a message
 * costs — and the two figures disagreeing about their decimals because `String(10.00)` is `"10"`.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE FIGURE AUDIT COULD NOT HAVE CAUGHT IT, CORRECTLY. `figureKind()` returns null unless an
 * element's own text is a figure ALONE; this text carries words, so it is prose and the audit
 * declines to police it — its own documented "TRAP TWO — A SENTENCE IS NOT A FIGURE". The currency
 * floor never applied. Nothing is wrong with the audit; the price sat in the one shape it does not
 * look at, which is why this needed a test of its own rather than a rule tightened over there.

/**

 *
 * The value is built from `String(value)` — the shortest representation that round-trips a double,
 * and precisely what React was already rendering — then padded to two decimals. So the fix is
 * additive by construction: it adds a mark and trailing zeros and cannot change any displayed
 * number. `price.test.ts` states that as a losslessness property over the catalog's real range
 * rather than as a handful of examples.
 *
 * Non-finite input renders an em dash rather than `$NaN`. The catalog is proxied from the
 * deployment's Lens, so this client does not get to assume the field arrived.
