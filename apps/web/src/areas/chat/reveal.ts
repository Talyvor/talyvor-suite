/**
 * reveal.ts — B16.3: an answer appears at a steady pace, however its bytes arrive.
 *
 * MEASURED 27 Sep, the whole chain (provider → Lens → BFF → Caddy 2.11.4 → this app in Chromium):
 * NO HOP BUFFERS. Lens, the BFF and Caddy each delivered a recorded gpt-4o-mini stream as 69–83
 * reads, 12–15 ms apart at the median, first text within 10 ms of the provider's. What the reader saw
 * was the arrival pattern itself: a live answer in bursts (one frame added 12% of the answer; gaps up
 * to 186 ms) and a cached answer in ONE frame — Lens replays a cached answer as a single delta
 * (replayAsSSE), so nothing downstream can stream it. The fix therefore lives here, in the display.
 *
 * The pace is set when text ARRIVES and held until the next arrival, so between arrivals the text
 * grows linearly rather than easing out:
 *  · while the answer is still arriving, whatever is waiting is shown over STREAM_HORIZON_MS — a
 *    burst is spread out, and the display is never more than that far behind the network;
 *  · once the whole answer is known (a finished stream, or a cached answer that arrived at once),
 *    the rest is shown at FINISHED_CPS, or faster if it would otherwise take longer than
 *    FINISH_HORIZON_MS. The pace never drops at that moment, so a live answer does not slow down
 *    as it ends.
