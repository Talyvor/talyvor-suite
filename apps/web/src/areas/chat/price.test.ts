// THE DEFECT, MEASURED AT RENDER TIME AND NOT READ:
//
//   List price · 2.5 in / 10 out per 1M tokens
//
// That is what the chat screen — the ONE surface whose product thesis is showing what a message
// costs — actually put in the DOM. There is no currency mark anywhere in it. `2.5` is not a
// quantity of anything named, and the two figures on one line disagree about their decimals
// because `String(10.00)` is `"10"`.
//
// ⚠ AND THE PRODUCT'S FIGURE AUDIT CANNOT SEE IT, BY DESIGN AND CORRECTLY. figureKind() returns
// null unless an element's own text is a figure ALONE; this text carries words, so it is prose and
// the audit declines to police it (its own "TRAP TWO — A SENTENCE IS NOT A FIGURE"). The currency
// floor therefore never applied here. The audit is not broken — the price simply sits in the one
// shape it does not look at.

  // per-1M rate: 0.015 is not < 0.01, so it takes the toFixed(2) branch.
  //
  // ⚠ AND IT ROUNDS **DOWN**, WHICH IS NOT THE DIRECTION "round half up" PREDICTS — I asserted
  // $0.02 here first and the test said $0.01. 0.015 has no exact double: it is stored as
  // 0.014999999999999999445, so toFixed(2) is correctly rounding a value that is BELOW the
  // midpoint. The house rule elsewhere in this product is that charges CEIL; this silently floors,
