// ⚠ THEY PERSIST IN THIS BROWSER, NOT ON A SERVER, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN RATHER THAN A SHORTCUT.
// Lens stores no prompt or response text (its migration 0009: "intentionally NOT stored in DB
// (privacy)"), and a server-side history would reverse that decision for every workspace. Keeping
// the text in localStorage gives "close the tab, reopen it, the conversation is still there"
// without a byte of it leaving the browser except to the model that answers it. The screen says
// so, because "saved" alone would be read as "saved to my account".
//
// ⚠ THE KEY IS SCOPED TO THE SIGNED-IN IDENTITY. One browser, two accounts, one unscoped key is
// one person reading the other's conversations.
