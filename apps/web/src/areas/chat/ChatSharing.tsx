// B28.381 — a chat kept out of the shared pool. "Sharing", under the composer, is on in a new chat, where the
// workspace's Answer sharing decides. Turned off, it is kept with the conversation (history.ts `pool_off`) and every
// question in it goes with chatApi.ts POOL_HEADER `off`: Lens puts none of its answers in the shared pool, so no other
// workspace is ever served one, and serves it none of theirs (talyvor-lens B28.133). The workspace's own cache still
// serves it its own earlier answers. With the workspace's Answer sharing off nothing is shared anyway, and it says so.
