/**
 * EVERY LINE OF TEXT IS SCORED AGAINST THE PLANE IT ACTUALLY LANDS ON, on every surface.
 *
 * `packages/ui/src/planes.ts` carries the measurement, the four numbers and why the plane set is
 * a classification rather than an exemption list. This file is the half that can see the DOM.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS NOT A SOURCE RULE, AND THE REASON IS NOT THE USUAL ONE ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The colour and the plane are declared in different places and neither knows about the other.
 * `NavItem`'s icon carries its own text token; the background it sits on is decided by the
 * BUTTON above it, and by whether that button is the selected one. `background-color` does not
 * inherit — but the plane a character is painted over is still whatever the nearest ancestor that
 * declares one is, which is the same ancestor walk `caseAudit.transformInEffect` and
 * `glyphAudit.effectiveFamily` each do for their own property. A grep for "a text token near a bg
 * token" connects nothing: they are 20 lines and one component boundary apart.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT ASKS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * For every element whose OWN TEXT is non-empty:
 *   · the nearest ancestor-or-self text token  (default `ink` — theme.css sets `color: var(--ink)`
 *     on `body`, so untokened text is ink, not unknown)
 *   · the nearest ancestor-or-self background token (default `canvas` — same rule, `background:
 *     var(--canvas)` on `body`)
 * and then three questions, in order, because a later one is meaningless if an earlier one fails:
 *   1. is the plane CLASSIFIED at all? An unclassified plane is an offender, not a pass — the
 *      `9e03e50` direction: a table that only ever grows quietly is a table that is not read.
 *   2. does the plane PERMIT that role? The refusal is a measured fact; see ROLES_ON_PLANE.
 *   3. does the pair clear AA body in BOTH themes? A pair ships in both, so the weaker theme is
 *      the answer, and the score is computed from `tokens.ts` rather than listed anywhere.
 *
 * ⚠ QUESTION 3 IS NOT REDUNDANT WITH QUESTION 2 AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. `contrast.test.ts` proves
 * every PERMITTED pair clears the floor today, so 3 can only fire on a pair that 2 already let
 * through — which is precisely what happens if somebody edits a hex in `tokens.ts` and updates the
 * classification to match. Two independent readings of the same fact, one from the table and one
 * from the palette, so neither can go quietly wrong alone.
 *
 * ⚠ STATED LIMITS, NOT IMPLIED:
 *   (a) IT CANNOT SEE A STATE JSDOM DOES NOT ENTER. `:hover` and `:active` never apply in a test,
 *       so a `hover:`-prefixed plane is invisible here. That is not a hole this audit can close
 *       from the DOM, and it is why the NavItem fix uses ONE token that clears the floor on every
 *       plane the row can be on rather than a token per state — a state-dependent answer would be
 *       unverifiable by the only instrument that can see the plane at all. The class lists that
 *       carry a variant plane are pinned in planeAudit.test.tsx instead, by name and with numbers.
 *   (b) IT SCORES TOKENS, NOT PIXELS. An element whose colour comes from anywhere but a token is
 *       `placeholderAudit.ts`'s question, not this one.
 *   (c) it rides apps/web's setup, so a surface with no test is audited by nothing — the limit
 *       test-setup.ts already states for the other five, inherited rather than new.

 * test renders some text, so "audited ≥1 pair" stays green with `planeOf` blinded to return the
 * default — the single edit that switches the interesting half of this audit off, since every
 * finding it can produce comes from an ancestor's `bg-` utility. Requiring a DECLARED plane
 * exercises the ancestor walk, which is the part a source rule could not do.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT CANNOT CATCH EVERYTHING, said rather than implied — the `f9f35ab` lesson. Four
 * failures, four catchers, each OBSERVED red by `scripts/w11-plane-controls.py` against a target
 * that contains no test of this module, so no verdict here names a test that did not run:
 *   · a dead observer            → THIS FLOOR (C4b, and the message it printed was this floor's
 *                                  own, on src/ConsoleTitle.test.tsx)
 *   · a blinded `judge`          → planeAudit.test.tsx's direct unit tests on real token values
 *                                  (C3); the floor cannot see this edit, which is the same
 *                                  independence focusAudit.ts records about its own predicate
 *   · a plane dropped from the classification → the OFFENDER rule on a real surface (C7b)
 *   · a blinded ancestor walk    → ⚠ THE OFFENDER RULE, NOT THIS FLOOR, and I had written the
 *                                  opposite before running it. With `planeOf` blinded to the body
 *                                  default, the primary Button's `accent-ink` label is suddenly
 *                                  scored against `canvas` — a pair the classification refuses at
 *                                  1.1:1 — so an offender is reported before any floor is
 *                                  consulted (C2b). The floor is a SECOND reader of that edit,
 *                                  not the first, and the distinction is only visible by reading
 *                                  which message the control actually printed.
