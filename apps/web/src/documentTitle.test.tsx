/**
 * THE BROWSER TAB NAMED NO PAGE — ON EVERY ADDRESS THE SUITE HAS.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MEASURED, AT `d26f9ad`, WITH EVERY GATE GREEN ───────────────────────────
 *
 * A throwaway probe drove the real `<App />` to 23 addresses and recorded, for each, the string
 * the banner paints and the value of `document.title`. The banner was right 23 times out of 23.
 * `document.title` was written ZERO times out of 23 — the probe set a sentinel before every
 * navigation and read the same sentinel back after every one:
 *
 *   /              banner "Overview"          document.title UNWRITTEN
 *   /ledger        banner "Ledger"            document.title UNWRITTEN
 *   /billing…      banner "Billing"           document.title UNWRITTEN
 *   … 12 console pages, 2 deep splat addresses, 3 not-founds, 6 public pages, all UNWRITTEN.
 *
 * And on the SHIPPED artifact rather than in jsdom: `apps/web/dist/assets/index-*.js` contains
 * `document.title` 0 times, with `Talyvor` and `Not found` present in the same file as the
 * positive control that the grep read the bundle at all. So the only title this product has ever
 * had is the ONE STATIC STRING in `index.html`, `Talyvor Suite`, and a single-page app never
 * re-reads that. Every tab, every bookmark, every history entry, and every screen reader
 * announcing a route change gets the same five syllables for all 23 states.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS `ConsoleTitle.test.tsx`'s DEFECT ONE CONSUMER OUT. That file exists because two
 * tables of paths had to agree and nothing asked whether they did; its fix made the BANNER name
 * the page you are on, and its own prose says why that matters — "to a screen reader arriving at
 * the banner landmark, it IS the page". The document has the same job for the browser, and it
 * was never wired to the answer the product already computes. A curated instrument guards what
 * it lists: ConsoleTitle reads `getByRole('banner')` and nothing reads `document`.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE FORMAT COMES FROM, MEASURED RATHER THAN CHOSEN ─────────────────────────
 *
 * The item is "suite redesign to the WEBSITE language", so the shape is the website's, fetched
 * 2026-08-10 from the live marketing site:
 *
 *   https://talyvor.higgsfield.app/pricing      <title>Pricing | TALYVOR</title>
 *   https://talyvor.higgsfield.app/economy      <title>The economy | TALYVOR</title>
 *   https://talyvor.higgsfield.app/attribution  <title>Attribution | TALYVOR</title>
 *   https://talyvor.higgsfield.app/self-host    <title>Self-host | TALYVOR</title>
 *   https://talyvor.higgsfield.app/             <title>TALYVOR: the AI development suite …</title>
 *
 * `<page> | <brand>`, and the FRONT DOOR carries the brand alone. Both halves are copied here.
 * The brand string is not the site's `TALYVOR` but this app's own shipped `<title>` — asserted
 * against `index.html` below, so the cold-load default and this module cannot drift.
 *
 * ⚠ NO PAGE NAME IS INVENTED. Every name below is a string the product already paints:
 * the twelve console names come from `CONSOLE_ROUTES`, the same table the banner reads (so the
 * tab and the header cannot disagree — asserted, not assumed); `Not found` is `NOT_FOUND_TITLE`;
 * `Privacy` and `Terms` are those pages' own `<h1>`; `Sign in` and `Create a workspace` are the
 * labels the product writes on its own links to `/signin` and `/signup` (areas/auth/Entry.tsx);
 * `Share your answers, and earn from them` is the consent screen's own `CardHeader`. `/marketing/*` takes
 * the brand alone because it IS the front door, which is what the website does with its own.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE SENTINEL IS LOAD-BEARING. `document.title` is one property of one jsdom document
 * that every test in this file shares, so a case that writes nothing passes on the PREVIOUS
 * case's title. Every case below overwrites it with a string no assertion accepts first.
