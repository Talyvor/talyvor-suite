/**
 * AN `id` IS A DOCUMENT-WIDE NAME, AND NOTHING IN THIS REPO CHECKED THAT TWO THINGS DID NOT TAKE
 * THE SAME ONE.
 *
 * ── HOW THIS WAS FOUND, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH KEEPING ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not by reading. W1.1.3's control C4 set a new region's `index` to `01`, colliding with the
 * balances region, and PREDICTED exactly one catcher — the index-sequence assertion. It was caught
 * by TWO, and the second catcher is the finding: `Region.tsx` built its label id as
 * `region-${index}-label` and pointed `aria-labelledby` at it, so two regions sharing an index
 * share a DOM id. `getElementById` returns the FIRST. **The second region's accessible name
 * silently becomes the first region's label** — a screen reader lists two sections called "What
 * you have", and nothing about the visible page changes.
 *
 * ── THE CLASS, MEASURED BEFORE THE INSTANCE WAS FIXED (W1.1.13's own instruction) ────────────
 *
 * "How many other id/aria-labelledby pairs in this app are built from a caller-supplied string
 * rather than a generated one? That is the class, not the instance." MEASURED at `5a82c89` across
 * both packages: **31 call sites in 5 files** carry an `id`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`
 * or `htmlFor`. The answer is sharper than the question expected:
 *
 *   · `Region.tsx` (3) was the ONLY one built from a caller-supplied string.
 *   · The other 28 — `Landing.tsx` ×18, `IssueDetail.tsx` ×4, `PageChangelog.tsx` ×4,
 *     `PageTranslation.tsx` ×2 — are CONSTANT LITERALS (`hero-heading`, `issue-description`).
 *   · **`useId` appears ZERO times in either package.** Not one id in this product is generated.
 *
 * So the class is not "callers supply ids"; it is "every id here is hand-written, and exactly one
 * of them was parameterised". The constants are safe only while each owning component renders at
 * most once per document, which is true today and is a fact nothing was checking either.
 *
 * ── AND THE DEFECT WAS LATENT, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS A SWEEP AND NOT AN EDIT ───────────────────
 *
 * MEASURED across all 17 addresses (the twelve `CONSOLE_ROUTES` plus /marketing, /privacy, /terms,
 * /signup, /signin) at `5a82c89`, BEFORE the fix: 44 ids rendered, **0 duplicates and 0 dangling
 * references**. There was nothing to repair. A defect that is invisible until someone reuses a
 * number is exactly the kind that arrives with the next screen rebuild, and six of those are still
 * OPEN — all of them instructed to use this component.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS NOT `LandmarkCoverage.test.tsx` A SECOND TIME, and the distinction is worth keeping so
 * the two are not merged later. That file asks whether the product's CONTENT SITS INSIDE a
 * landmark — coverage, "is any readable text outside every region". This one asks whether the
 * landmarks that exist are DISTINCTLY NAMED — identity. A screen can be perfectly covered and
 * still report two sections with one name; that is precisely the state W1.1.3's control produced.

 * over the deliberately-broken fixtures below. A predicate that only ever sees correct input is a
 * predicate nobody has tested — every one of the controls at the bottom of this file feeds this
 * exact function something wrong and requires it to say so.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT COUNTS RATHER THAN LOOKING UP. `document.getElementById` returns the FIRST match and
 * cannot report that there were two, which is precisely the failure being hunted: the browser
 * resolves a duplicated `aria-labelledby` silently and successfully. `querySelector('#' + id)` is
 * not an option either — MEASURED: React 18.3.1's `useId()` emits `:r0:`, and
 * `querySelector('#:r0:-label')` throws `SyntaxError: is not a valid selector`. So the census
 * collects the ids as strings and counts them.
