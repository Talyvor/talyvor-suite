/**
 * MONOSPACE FOR EVERY NUMERAL — the rule `6aecb0d` (#88) wrote down and never swept for.
 *
 * #88 built the face: `font-figure` is `var(--mono)` plus `font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1`,
 * and the brief it came from says "MONOSPACE FOR EVERY NUMERAL". It ported Overview and left
 * the token available. Nothing ever asked whether the rest of the product used it.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED 2026-08-09 at `5d65b3e`: `formatUSD` had FIVE render sites and exactly ONE was on
 * the figure face. The other four were `text-body text-muted` — the body sans. Three of them
 * are the same shape, and it is the shape that makes this worth a guard rather than four
 * commits:
 *
 *     <MuNumeral micros={…balance_ulxc} unit="lxc" />          ← the figure face
 *     <span className="text-body text-muted">≈ {formatUSD(…)}</span>   ← the sans
 *
 * The dollar figure sits immediately beside the LXC figure it converts, at the same baseline,
 * in a different typeface. It is the same money twice, and only one of the two looks measured.
 * Overview, TopUp and BillingReturn all did it; a fourth put the balance in a sentence.
 *
 * TWO RULES, because one of them alone has a blind spot the other closes:
 *
 *   A. NAME-SHAPED. Any function whose name reads like money — /usd|cents|cost|price/i —
 *      rendered into JSX must land on the figure face. It is what reaches a LOCAL helper no
 *      module exports and no import list mentions, which rule B's census cannot see.
 *      ⚠ AS OF `2bee9fc` RULE A HAS NO INSTANCE OF ITS OWN, AND THAT IS SAID HERE RATHER THAN
 *      LEFT TO BE DISCOVERED. Its one real subject was `costLabel` in IssueDetail.tsx; that
 *      helper is now `areas/track/format.ts#formatCost`, an EXPORT, so rule B classifies it and
 *      rule B's face check already covers it. Measured with the whole suite green: every
 *      money-named function rendered into JSX in this product is now an exported `format*`
 *      (formatUSD, formatCents, formatCost), so rule A's unique coverage — money-shaped names
 *      that are not `format*` — is currently EMPTY. It stays because the next local helper is
 *      exactly what it exists to catch, but nothing in the product demonstrates it today.
 *   B. CLASSIFIED. Every `format*` exported ANYWHERE under the scanned roots is classified below
 *      as A FIGURE or NOT ONE, WITH ITS REASON, and the classification is checked against the
 *      source in both directions. A formatter nobody classifies fails this file rather than
 *      defaulting into "not a figure" — the #407 move, and the one that stops rule A from
 *      quietly missing a new `formatBalance` that happens not to match the name shape.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ RULE B'S CENSUS COULD NOT DELIVER THAT PROMISE, IN TWO INDEPENDENT WAYS, AND BOTH WERE
 * MEASURED WITH THE WHOLE SUITE GREEN AT `31095b7` (1010 tests, twice):
 *
 *   · ITS SCOPE WAS A HAND-KEPT LIST OF THREE FILE PATHS. Adding `export function formatBalance`
 *     to `areas/lens/topupApi.ts` — a module the list does not name — changed NOTHING: 1010
 *     passed. That is rule B's own stated reason to exist, arriving through the one door it did
 *     not watch. And the list was ALREADY STALE when this was written: `topupApi.ts` exports
 *     `formatCents`, a real money formatter on a buy button, and no entry classified it.
 *   · ITS KEY WAS THE FUNCTION NAME. `exportedFormatters()` accumulated into a `Set` of NAMES,
 *     so the three listed modules' FIVE exported functions collapsed into THREE entries. Adding
 *     a second `formatUSD` — a different unit contract under an already-classified name — also
 *     changed nothing: 1010 passed. The duplication was half-noticed (a comment acknowledged the
 *     second `formatWhen`) and never swept for; the unacknowledged collision is on MONEY, and
 *     the two `formatUSD` arguments differ by a factor of 10^6 (µUSD vs float USD).
 *
 * ⚠ AND A DELETION WAS INVISIBLE FOR THE SAME REASON: un-exporting track's `formatUSD` left
 * lens's namesake in the set, so the both-directions check saw NO change. The control still
 * scored CAUGHT — by `format.test.ts`, the mutated module's OWN unit test, which is not this
 * guard. A verdict read from a count would have recorded that hole as covered.
 *
 * The census is now DISCOVERED from the roots rather than listed, and keyed by `module#name`.
