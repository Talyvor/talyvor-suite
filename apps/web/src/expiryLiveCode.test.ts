/**
 * A PREMISE READ OUT OF A COMMENT IS NOT A PREMISE THAT HOLDS.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND WHY IT IS NOT expirySubjects.test.ts ───────────────
 *
 * `expirySubjects.test.ts` closes ONE door: it runs `deploy/decision-expiry.sh` with each
 * subject file MOVED ASIDE and fails on any `ok` that survives. That proves a check TOUCHES
 * the file it names. It does not prove the check reads the CODE in that file, and those are
 * different questions — the register's own history says so twice:
 *
 *   · D7's header: "It matched `member-sync` anywhere in apps/bff/*.go, which the test file and
 *     these very comments satisfy — so deleting the production call left the check GREEN."
 *   · D9's header: "THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS CHECK GREPPED THE WHOLE FILE FOR `assetsDir` AND
 *     VOIDED IMMEDIATELY — on the COMMENT that was added in the same change to warn against
 *     setting it. A guard that cannot tell a mention from a setting reports the documentation
 *     as the defect."
 *
 * Both lessons were learned INSIDE this register and applied to the check that taught them.
 * Neither was applied to the others, and nothing has ever asked.
 *
 * ── MEASURED, NOT REASONED ABOUT (tab-d7q2, 2026-08-28, main 94b9899) ────────
 *
 * Each PRESENCE check's live site was turned into a comment — the file still present, still
 * non-empty, the matched text still there one `// ` to the left — and the register re-run:
 *
 *     D3  compose vars commented       →  VOID   (its pattern anchors after leading space)
 *     D5  stampBuild() commented       →  ok     ⚠ the plugin is GONE and D5 says it is present
 *     D7  the nudge call commented     →  ok     ⚠ the call is GONE and D7 says the BFF makes it
 *     D9  bundleAssetsDir commented    →  VOID   (its pattern is anchored `^const … = "assets"$`)
 *
 * D5 and D7 printed "All locally-checkable premises still hold." For D5 the survivor is the
 * doc comment at the top of apps/web/vite.config.ts that DESCRIBES the plugin; for D7 it is the
 * commented-out call itself, which `grep -qF 'a.nudgeDocsMemberSync('` matches exactly as well
 * as the live one did.
 *
 * ⚠ THE PRODUCT IS DEFENDED IN BOTH CASES, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, AND IT IS SAID HERE
 * RATHER THAN LEFT FLATTERING:
 *
 *   · D7 — commenting the whole `if trackWS != ""` block COMPILES (`go build ./...` exit 0,
 *     `go vet` clean) and `TestDocsNudge_FailureDoesNotAbortLogin` then FAILS. Run and read.
 *   · D5 — the mutation this file applies does NOT survive `tsc`: commenting the plugin out
 *     leaves `Plugin`, `bundleVersionPayload` and friends imported and unused. The realistic
 *     removal is the CLEAN one (pipeline entry, definition and the now-dead imports all gone),
 *     and that one typechecks, builds, and is caught one step later: `scripts/build-release.sh
 *     web` exits 1 with "apps/web/dist/version.json is missing … The stamping plugin did not
 *     run." That step is in CI. So D5's blindness costs a deployer a WRONG ANSWER FROM THE
 *     REGISTER, not an unstamped release.
 *
 * What was blind is the REGISTER, whose whole job is to tell a deployer that a documented
 * decision still rests on something true. A gate that is green because it read a paragraph is
 * the failure this register was written to prevent, arriving through its own front door.
 *
 * ── DIRECTION, AND WHY ONLY ONE OF THE TWO IS A RULE HERE ────────────────────
 *
 * A PRESENCE check says `ok` when its pattern is FOUND. A comment satisfying it is a FALSE PASS
 * and nothing else fires. That is the rule below.
 *
 * An ABSENCE check says `ok` when its pattern is NOT found, so a comment mentioning the
 * forbidden thing makes it VOID — CI goes red about a paragraph. That is a real cost and it was
 * measured too (D2, D4, D6 and D8 are all unanchored, D9's vite half strips comments and D1's
 * pattern is anchored), but it fails LOUD: somebody investigates and finds the comment. Making
 * those four quieter is a judgement about a deploy gate, so it is reported and not taken here.

/**
 * ⚠ AND A SHAPE RULE, BECAUSE THE FIRST FIX FOR D7 WAS GREEN ON macOS AND RED ON LINUX AND A
 * FULL LOCAL GAUNTLET DID NOT SEE IT.
 *
 * The register runs under `set -uo pipefail` (its own line 40). GNU `grep -q` exits the instant
 * it matches; the upstream stage of the pipeline is then killed by SIGPIPE, the pipeline's
 * status is 141, and any `&& …` / `|| …` hanging off it takes the WRONG branch. BSD grep reads
 * to EOF, so the identical pipeline returns 0 on a workstation.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-08-28 in debian:bookworm-slim against this repo, both directions:
 *
 *     grep -v … apps/bff/auth.go | grep -qF 'a.nudgeDocsMemberSync('   -> 141   (pipefail)
 *     the same pipeline with `set +o pipefail`                          -> 0
 *     the same pipeline on macOS                                        -> 0
 *
 * D7 therefore VOIDED on a healthy premise and took the register's exit code with it. ⚠⚠ AND
 * D9's vite half was the SAME SHAPE ALREADY, failing in the worse direction: `… | grep -qE
 * '\bassetsDir\b' || _d9_vite=1` would have reported "vite still writes there (default
 * assetsDir)" ABOUT A FILE THAT SETS assetsDir — the exact state D9 exists to detect. It
 * measured 0 rather than 141 only because vite.config.ts has ~2 KB left to write after the
 * match where auth.go has ~10.8 KB. It was safe by the size of a file, and files grow.
 *
 * So: in the LOCAL half, never read the status of a pipeline that ends in `grep -q`. Count with
 * `grep -c`, which reads to EOF, and compare the number. The `cannot` strings are excluded
 * because they are commands for a DEPLOYER's shell, not statements in this one — two of them do
 * pipe `go test` into `grep -q`, and there the same accident would be a false MOVED, which is
 * loud. That is a real difference in direction and it is why this rule is scoped rather than
 * global.
