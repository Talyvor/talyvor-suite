/**
 * THE BFF'S COPY OF LENS'S MONEY ALLOW-LIST IS TIED TO THE DEPLOY-TIME COMMAND THAT CHECKS IT.
 *
 * ── THE FINDING THIS EXISTS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * apps/bff/billing.go's header lists three mitigations for copying Lens's top-up allow-list into
 * this repo. The second was: "a test pins the values against the Lens source". MEASURED — it does
 * not. `TestAllowedTopUpsMirrorLens` declared `want := []int64{1000, 5000, 10000}` as a literal in
 * the SAME package and compared `allowedTopUpCents` to it. It read nothing of talyvor-lens, and
 * could not: CI checks out this repository alone.
 *
 * The claim was INERT rather than wrong-today — lens a04310a internal/billing/billing.go:47 is
 * `var allowedTopUps = []int64{1000, 5000, 10000}`, byte for byte the same three sizes. What made
 * it worth a merge is the DIRECTION the list is documented to move in. Both files say the list is
 * ADDITIVE-ONLY (a webhook re-checks it days later, so removing a size would mark a legitimately
 * paid purchase anomalous). So the expected change is an APPEND, and an append is exactly what
 * nothing saw: Lens starts selling a fourth size, `amountAllowed` here refuses it before any dial,
 * /api/lxc/topup-options never offers it, the screen never draws the button, and neither repo goes
 * red. The REMOVAL direction was already covered — Lens answers 400 and handleLXCCheckout reports
 * allow-list drift naming both lists — which is why only this one direction was open.
 *
 * ── WHY THE FIX IS A REGISTER ENTRY AND NOT A TEST ───────────────────────────
 *
 * No test in this repo can read talyvor-lens. A guard that reads it WHEN PRESENT would be inert in
 * CI, which is precisely where it must fire — the same "green because it can never be red" shape
 * the finding is made of. deploy/decision-expiry.sh is what this repo already built for premises
 * that live where it cannot read: they are printed as UNCHECKABLE, never as passes, with a command
 * a deployer runs in the named repo. The premise moved there.
 *
 * That command was proved fail-closed in every state, in a real talyvor-lens checkout, before it
 * was written down — not reasoned into:
 *
 *   the three sizes as they are today        [ "$(grep -c '^var allowedTopUps = …{1000, 5000, 10000}$' …)" = 1 ]   EXIT 0
 *   the same command against an APPENDED fourth size (the arrival case)                                            EXIT 1
 *   the same command with the file absent — grep writes nothing, `[ "" = 1 ]` is false                             EXIT 1
 *   ⚠ the bare form this repo forbids, `grep -c … FILE`, on that same absent file                                  EXIT 2
 *
 * apps/web/src/settleCommands.test.ts polices the SHAPE of that command (it is a `grep -c` entry,
 * so it must compare the count rather than trust grep's exit status). This file polices the other
 * half, the half a shape rule cannot see: THE VALUES IN THE COMMAND ARE THE VALUES THIS REPO
 * ENFORCES. A register entry naming a stale list settles the wrong question and reports a pass for
 * it, which is worse than having no entry at all.
 *
 * ── THE SECOND FINDING: THE SENTENCE A HUMAN READS WAS NOT THE ONE THAT WAS PINNED ───────────
 *
 * The register entry is one `cannot` call with three arguments — a DECISION, a PREMISE, and the
 * settle COMMAND. The rule above pins the third. MEASURED at `f64ab7c`: the FIRST argument, the
 * line the register PRINTS to a deployer, spells the same list in prose — "Lens still accepts
 * exactly $10 / $50 / $100" — and nothing tied it to anything. Propagate an append the way the
 * guards demand (the declaration, TestAllowedTopUpsRestatedDeliberately, the command in this
 * entry) and the whole tree stays green with that sentence still naming three sizes. The entry
 * would then grep for four and TELL THE DEPLOYER it was checking three: an entry whose prose has
 * gone stale settles the wrong question in the reader's head while the machine half settles the
 * right one, which is the same defect this file was written for, one argument to the left.
 *
 * The same census found the prose in three more places, all unpinned, all on the money path —
 * named by the comment they sit in rather than by line, because a line number in a comment is the
 * claim `upstreamCitations.test.ts` was written about:
 *
 *     apps/bff/billing.go                 the header's account of why the list is copied at all
 *     apps/bff/billing.go                 the doc comment on the declaration itself
 *     apps/bff/billing.go                 formatUSDCents's doc, which spells the three as its
 *                                         examples of what it renders
 *     apps/web/src/areas/lens/topupApi.ts the header section headed WHY THE AMOUNTS ARE FETCHED,
 *                                         NEVER HARDCODED — which then hardcodes them in prose
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THIS IS A DERIVATION AND NOT A SECOND COPY OF A MONEY FORMATTER. The reason the previous
 * session left this open was that pinning the prose looked like it needed `formatUSDCents`
 * rewritten in TypeScript — a second money renderer to keep honest. It does not: the rule below
 * reads the NUMERALS out of the prose and multiplies by 100. There is no rendering decision in it
 * (no grouping, no cents, no symbol placement), so there is nothing for it to disagree with the
 * shipped formatters about. An amount that is NOT a whole number of dollars is not matched at all,
 * which is also the escape hatch: a comment that needs to name a non-size writes it with cents.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IS EXCLUDED, AND WHY, SO THE SCOPE IS NOT MISTAKEN FOR A SWEEP. Each subject is a REGION
 * chosen by a stated rule — a file's comments, a header comment, one argument of one call — not a
 * hand-picked line. Two other places in the repo name the three amounts and are NOT policed here:
 * figureAudit.ts's TRAP TWO paragraph quotes a rendered REFUSAL MESSAGE as an example inside a
 * rationale (a quotation of an output, not a statement of the list — and it is split across two
 * lines, so a per-region rule would read half of it), and the `.test.tsx` files that assert a
 * MOCKED BFF response are fixtures — an append does not make a fixture wrong. Both are recorded
 * here rather than silently left out.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GUARD DOES AND DOES NOT CLAIM ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does NOT claim the BFF's list equals Lens's. Nothing in this repository's CI can claim that,
 * and this file saying otherwise would rebuild the defect one layer up. It claims exactly one
 * link: the list the deployer's command asks about is the list this BFF enforces. Lens's half of
 * the chain is answered by running that command, and by nothing here. The prose rule adds one
 * more link of the same kind: the sentences that SAY what the list is say what it is.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT DOES, WHICH WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. With a fourth
 * size appended and propagated to the declaration, the Go restatement and the settle command —
 * and this file deleted — the other 96 web test files, `go test ./...` and decision-expiry.sh
 * are ALL GREEN, and the register prints the stale sentence while exiting 0. Deleting the prose
 * rules here does not fall back on a weaker check; it falls back on nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ THE TWO FLOORS ARE NOT DECORATION. Both sides are parsed out of source, so a rename, a
 * reformat, or a deleted entry yields no match — at which point an equality rule over two empty
 * lists passes having read nothing. Each side is asserted to parse EXACTLY ONE subject, so the
 * ways this guard can stop seeing are reds rather than silences.
