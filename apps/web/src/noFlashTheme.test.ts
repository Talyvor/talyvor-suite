/**
 * THE FIRST PAINT ON A BROWSER THAT REFUSES SITE DATA — AND THE PREFERENCE IT THREW AWAY.
 *
 * `index.html`'s no-flash script is the only thing that decides which theme the product paints
 * on a cold load. `lib/theme.ts`'s `initialTheme()` READS THE ATTRIBUTE THAT SCRIPT SET and
 * trusts it — its own comment says the value came "from stored choice or prefers-color-scheme",
 * and its own storage fall-through is therefore unreachable in apps/web. So the script's answer
 * IS the product's answer, and nothing in this repo had ever run it.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT DID, MEASURED IN REAL CHROME ON `dist/index.html` — the built artifact, not a copy,
 * served over http and driven with `prefers-color-scheme` emulated. TWO INDEPENDENT INSTRUMENTS,
 * because the first one lost the stylesheet to CORS and could only report the attribute:
 *
 *   (1) The page in a `sandbox="allow-scripts"` iframe. That is an OPAQUE ORIGIN and Chrome
 *       itself throws from the `localStorage` GETTER there — no stub, no page edit:
 *         SecurityError: Failed to read the 'localStorage' property from 'Window'
 *         prefers-color-scheme: dark  →  data-theme="light"
 *       The control iframe, identical but for `allow-same-origin`, painted `data-theme="dark"`.
 *
 *   (2) The page top-level, with the same SecurityError installed on the `localStorage` getter
 *       before any page script runs, so the stylesheet loads and the PAINT is visible:
 *         storage works  · prefers dark   → data-theme=dark   body canvas  rgb(6,10,18)
 *         storage refused · prefers dark  → data-theme=light  body canvas  rgb(243,246,250)
 *         storage refused · prefers light → data-theme=light  body canvas   (right, by accident)
 *
 * A reader whose OS says dark, on a browser that refuses site data, got the LIGHT canvas on a
 * product whose brief is "Obsidian near-black". Not for a frame — for the whole session, on every
 * load, because the choice they make with the toggle is the one thing that browser cannot keep.
 *
 * ⚠ THE CAUSE IS THE SHAPE, NOT THE VALUE: ONE `try` HELD BOTH READS. The stored choice and
 * `prefers-color-scheme` are two independent questions, and only the first one can be refused —
 * `matchMedia` answers fine on a browser with no storage at all. Wrapping them together meant a
 * refusal on the first discarded the second, and the catch arm fell back to a hard-coded
 * `'light'`. `#120` fixed the WRITE half of this same key in `lib/theme.ts` and left the note
 * that index.html "has always wrapped its read in try/catch" — it had; that was the defect.
 *
 * ⚠ CASE 6 IS NOT DECORATION. Splitting the catch is only correct if the SECOND read is guarded
 * too: `window.matchMedia` is absent on old and embedded engines, and an unguarded call there
 * throws out of the IIFE, sets NO attribute at all, and theme.css defines every token under
 * `[data-theme=…]` — so the page would render with no canvas, no ink and no accent. That failure
 * is strictly worse than the one being fixed, and main does not have it.
