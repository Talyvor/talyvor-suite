/**
 * ConsoleHeading.test.tsx — THE SIGNED-IN CONSOLE RENDERED NO HEADING ELEMENT AT ALL, SO NOTHING
 * IN IT COULD BE REACHED BY THE ONE NAVIGATION A SCREEN-READER USER REACHES FOR FIRST.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MEASURED, IN THE DOM RATHER THAN IN THE SOURCE ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A throwaway probe drove the real `<App />` to all twelve `CONSOLE_ROUTES` addresses and counted
 * `document.querySelectorAll('h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6')` at each:
 *
 *     /  /ledger  /billing  /billing/success  /billing/cancel  /keys
 *     /setup  /spend  /members  /settings  /track  /docs        →  headings = 0, all twelve
 *
 *     TOTAL heading elements across every gated address: 0 of 12 pages had one.
 *
 * The page name WAS on the screen the whole time — `App.tsx` painted it as
 * `<div className="min-w-0 truncate text-head text-ink">{page}</div>` — so a sighted reader saw a
 * page title and assistive technology saw an anonymous box. Pressing `H` (jump to next heading),
 * or asking for the heading list, returned nothing on every screen behind the gate.
 *
 * ⚠ THE COUNT IS RE-DERIVED, NOT INHERITED. The queue carried "the gated console renders exactly
 * ONE heading element", counted from SOURCE with a newline-tolerant matcher, that one being
 * `IssueDetail.tsx`'s `<h1>`. That figure is about the whole product and is consistent with this
 * one: IssueDetail is reached at `/track/<id>`, deeper than any address in `CONSOLE_ROUTES`, so at
 * the twelve addresses a person actually lands on, the rendered count is ZERO. A source census and
 * a per-address DOM census answer different questions; this file asserts the second.
 *
 * ── WHY THE HEADING IS THE ONE IN THE BANNER ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not a new element and not a second copy of the title: the element that already names the page
 * becomes the heading it was behaving as. `ConsoleTitle.test.tsx` made this argument in prose when
 * it fixed the string — "to a screen reader arriving at the banner landmark, it IS the page" — and
 * `9e5560e` extended the same computed `page` value to `document.title`. One expression, now three
 * consumers: the tab, the visible title, and the heading.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS MEASURED ZERO-PIXEL, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS STRUCTURE AND NOT DESIGN. Read out of the
 * BUILT artifact (`dist/assets/index-*.css`, sha256 6ac40c1be2bc…, 22,420 bytes) rather than
 * assumed from what Tailwind is believed to emit — every rule in the shipped sheet whose selector
 * list contains `h1` as a token:
 *
 *     h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6                        { font-size:inherit; font-weight:inherit }
 *     blockquote,dl,dd,h1,…,h6,hr,figure,p,pre { margin:0 }
 *
 * and `.text-head{font-size:17px;line-height:1.3;font-weight:600}` supplies the type either way.
 * An `<h1>` carrying the same classes paints the same pixels as the `<div>` did; the stylesheet is
 * byte-identical across the change.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND THE VACUITY IT CLOSES ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "There is a heading" is satisfied by an EMPTY heading, and "there is a heading with text" is
 * satisfied by the SAME text on every page — both are worse than the div, because they announce a
 * structure that does not inform. So the names are PINNED AS LITERALS below and the table must
 * equal `CONSOLE_ROUTES` in BOTH directions: a page added without naming it here fails, and a name
 * left here after its route goes fails too.
 *
 * ⚠ THE NAMES ARE NOT READ FROM `titleFor`. A guard that asks the code under test what it should
 * say agrees with it for every possible value of it — this queue has paid for that shape twice.

 * transaction that sent you there would name a page the reader is not on.
