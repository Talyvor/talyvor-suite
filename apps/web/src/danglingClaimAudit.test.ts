/**
 * A DELETION LEAVES ITS DOCUMENTATION BEHIND, AND FOUR SURVIVORS OF ONE DELETION WERE LIVE.
 *
 * Suite #59 (`030ea53`) removed the `docs_shared` key from `/auth/me` — the BFF stopped serving
 * it and the client interface stopped declaring it. What the commit did NOT remove was the prose
 * describing it. Measured at `8ba994f`, four claims about that field were still in the source,
 * and each had attached itself to something else:
 *
 *   apps/bff/auth.go        five comment lines about the removed key, the last one CUT OFF
 *                           MID-SENTENCE by the same commit, sitting directly above the
 *                           `signup_open` entry so they read as ITS documentation — and naming
 *                           `docsWorkspaceID` as "the pin", a config field `track_tenant_test.go`
 *                           asserts can never come back.
 *   apps/web/src/lib/api.ts the removed member's doc block orphaned in front of the NEXT member's
 *                           own doc block. Its sentence "Absent (older BFF) is treated as false:
 *                           silence must not manufacture a warning" thereby became policy for a
 *                           CONSENT field whose absent-handling is the opposite.
 *   PoolingConsent.tsx      a `See …` sending the reader to a module deleted by the same commit —
 *                           twelve lines above a paragraph in the same file saying that module's
 *                           subject is gone.
 *   Entry.test.tsx          a fixture comment announcing the key was about to follow. It did not.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS REPOSITORY'S OWN REGISTER SAID THE OPPOSITE. `apps/bff/cited_guard_test.go` recorded, as
 * the documented reason a deleted test may still be cited, that "/auth/me no longer serves
 * docs_shared, so the disclosure cannot outlive the pin it described". It outlived it four times.
 * A register entry is a claim like any other and that one was checked by nothing.
 *
 * ── WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS GUARD ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two blanket rules were measured first and both are dead, so they are written down here rather
 * than re-derived by whoever reads this next.
 *
 *   "every bare path named in a comment must resolve" — 2795 mentions across the repo, 203
 *   distinct unresolved, and MOST ARE HONEST: cross-repo basenames, shell variables, and files
 *   named precisely BECAUSE they are gone ("it used to render seven fabricated pages from
 *   ./fixtures.ts", "replaces the deleted shared scaffold test"). A rule needing a 200-entry
 *   allowlist is prose wearing an assertion's clothes.
 *
 *   "a comment naming a camelCase identifier must name one declared in the package" — 297 in
 *   `apps/bff`, 32 unresolved, most of them legitimate references to Lens and web symbols. Also
 *   dead.
 *
 * The two rules below were chosen because each is mechanically exact, needs NO allowlist, and
 * measured EXACTLY ONE red on the source it was written against. An allowlist was not omitted
 * for tidiness — neither rule has one because neither rule needs one, and if either ever does,
 * that is the signal the rule was wrong rather than the source.
 *
 * ── THE LIMIT, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Neither rule reads intent. RULE A does not know whether the orphaned block is about a removed
 * member or is a second thought about the live one; it knows only that a member carries two, and
 * that a member documented twice is documented by nobody. RULE B does not know whether the
 * sentence describes the file correctly; it knows only that you cannot go and read a file that is
 * not there. Both pin STRUCTURE, and both were measured against the state that produced the four
 * defects above rather than argued for.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THIS FILE OBEYS RULE B, which is why the deleted module above is described rather than
 * cited. Writing `See <that path>` here would make this header the guard's own first offender —
 * the same reason `cited_guard_test.go` describes its ten dangling test names instead of spelling
 * them. That is not a limitation worked around; it is the rule working on the file that adds it.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IS STILL OUT OF SCOPE, SAID OUT LOUD: the `apps/bff` half. The Go comment was found by
 * the same reading, and the mechanical tell it shares — a comment block whose final line ends
 * mid-sentence — measures 872 blocks in that package with 31 flagged, of which 27 are section
 * banners ending in a box-drawing rule. That rule is plausible and cheap but it needs its own
 * allowlist and its own controls in a different language, so it is priced here and not smuggled
 * into a TypeScript guard that cannot run it.
