        This is an honest description of the service written by its engineers so a lawyer can turn
        it into an agreement. It is <strong>not</strong> a contract: it names no governing law, no
        jurisdiction, no liability position, no warranty disclaimer and no dispute process. Do not
        rely on it as one.

      <Section title="Early software">
        <p className="text-reading">
          Talyvor is early software offered for evaluation. Features appear, change and are removed.
          Screens you use today may not exist next month. We will try not to surprise you, but the
          honest expectation is instability, not stability.

      <Section title="LENS and LXC are usage credits">
        <p className="text-reading">
          <strong>LXC</strong> is what you buy and spend on inference. <strong>LENS</strong> is what
          some contribution mechanisms pay out. Both are internal balances in our database,
          decremented as you use the service.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading">
          They are <strong>not money</strong>, not a deposit, not a stored-value instrument, not a
          security, and not any kind of investment. They confer no ownership of anything and no
          claim on the company. They exist to meter usage of this service.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading">
          <strong>LXC can be cashed out.</strong> In Agent Wallets, a workspace&rsquo;s owner can ask
          to turn an agent&rsquo;s LXC back into money, paid by Talyvor&rsquo;s payments partner to an
          account they name. The credits are held while it is paid and come back if the payment
          fails. Until our first money partner is switched on, a cash-out doesn&rsquo;t move real
          money yet. Earned LENS converts to LXC.
        </p>
        <LawyerReview compact>
          Whether an internal credit that is purchased with real money constitutes stored value or
          e-money is jurisdiction-specific, and a credit that can be cashed out is closer to it than
          one that cannot. This paragraph describes the mechanism; it does not settle the question.
        </LawyerReview>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Agent Wallets">
        <p className="text-reading">
          Each agent you create has a wallet: LXC you move into it from your workspace, rules for
          what it may spend, and a statement of everything it did. Lens enforces those rules before
          a model call or a payment is made. A request or payment the rules refuse is not made; one
          over the approval amount waits for a person to approve it, and with a passkey that
          approval is signed on your own device.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading">
          <strong>An agent spends what its rules allow without asking anyone.</strong> The rules are
          what stand between an agent and its wallet, so set them to what you are prepared to have
          spent. Pausing an agent, or every agent at once, stops it until you resume it.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading text-muted">
          An agent can pay other agents, including another company&rsquo;s, hold money in escrow and
          pots, and lend to or borrow from another company. None of these moves real money until our
          first money partner is switched on, and an agent&rsquo;s virtual card can&rsquo;t make
          real purchases yet. Investing is simulated: simulated US dollars at real prices, never real
          assets.
        </p>
        <LawyerReview compact>
          Who is liable for a payment an agent makes within its rules, for a payment to another
          owner&rsquo;s agent, and for a loan between companies that is not repaid is not defined
          here. That needs a position before any of these moves real money.

      <Section title="The Marketplace">
        <p className="text-reading">
          The Marketplace lists agents, prompts, skills, evaluations and pipelines published by other
          Talyvor workspaces. Using one runs it through Lens as your workspace. A paid listing&rsquo;s
          price goes on your monthly marketplace bill, never on your credits.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading">
          A listing is its seller&rsquo;s work, not Talyvor&rsquo;s. Lens checks each one before it is
          published and refuses one that carries a secret, personal data or a prompt injection.
          Anyone who can see a listing can report it; Talyvor reviews reported and held listings and
          can take one down for good, which refunds every use of it still inside the 14-day holdback.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading text-muted">
          Only a workspace&rsquo;s owner or an admin can publish. A seller earns 85% of every use,
          rental and purchase whose bill was paid; Talyvor keeps 15%. Earnings are held for 14 days for refunds, then paid once a week to a
          Stripe account the seller connects, less Stripe&rsquo;s fees at cost — or taken at once as
          Talyvor credits, with no fees and no minimum. Each weekly payout has a statement of its sales,
          fees, royalties and refunds. A seller gives Talyvor their tax details before they are paid;
          payouts to a seller whose details are still incomplete after three requests are held until
          they are complete. A refund after the seller was paid is recovered from their next earnings.

      <Section title="Earning is experimental, and some of it does not pay">
        <p className="text-reading">
          The service describes ways contributions can earn LENS. Several of those mechanisms are
          switched off or under evaluation. A contribution can be genuine and produce no ledger
          entry.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading text-muted">
          Where a mechanism is under evaluation, what it <em>would</em> have paid is recorded for
          our own checking and never credited — it does not reach your balance. Your balance and
          ledger show only what you have actually been paid. This is the same statement the app
          makes on the sharing screen, and it is deliberately the same words.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading text-muted">
          Rates, caps and eligibility can change, including to zero. Nothing here is a promise of
          future earnings.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="⚠ Earned LENS is not yours to spend straight away">
        <p className="text-reading">
          When a contribution earns LENS, it does not arrive in your spendable balance. It lands in
          a <strong>holding period</strong> first: the app shows it as held, you cannot spend or
          convert it, and it becomes spendable on its own once the period is over. Nothing is
          required from you and there is no button to press.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading">
          <strong>During that period the payout can be reversed.</strong> If we determine that an
          earning was gamed, or that the shared answer it was paid for was bad, an operator can
          revoke it and the held amount is removed before it ever becomes spendable. That is what
          the holding period is for — it is the window in which a payout can still be contested.
          Once it settles, it is not clawed back.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading text-muted">
          We do not fix the length here on purpose. It is an operator setting, not a term of this
          document, and this same page ships with self-hosted installations whose operator may have
          chosen a different one. Your balance screen shows the held amount and says that it settles
          after a holding period during which it can be revoked; it deliberately does not print a
          length, because the app cannot read the operator&rsquo;s setting and a number it could
          not verify would be worse than none.
        </p>
        <LawyerReview compact>
          This is a delay and a discretionary reversal on amounts already described to the user as
          earned. Who decides, on what evidence, whether the user is told, and whether they can
          contest it are all undefined in the code — the revocation is an operator action with no
          notice mechanism and no appeal path. That needs a position before anything of value
          depends on it.

      <Section title="Documents you attach">
        <p className="text-reading">
          When you attach a document, we convert it to Markdown before the model sees it. The model
          reads the converted text, not your original file. This is on unless you turn it off, and
          it is on because the converted text is smaller — you are charged for the smaller thing.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading">
          <strong>If a file has no text to extract</strong> — a scan, a photograph, an image-only
          PDF — it is sent to a <strong>vision model</strong> to be read. That is an extra model
          call on your document, and it costs tokens rather than saving them.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-reading text-muted">
          The converted text is what everything downstream treats as your prompt, so what{' '}

          There is no service level agreement, no availability target and no support commitment. The

        <LawyerReview compact>
          No refund policy for purchased LXC exists in the code or in this document; the only

      <Section title="⚠ Deleting your data">
        <p className="text-reading">
          In Features, a workspace&rsquo;s owner or an admin can delete the answers it shared, or
          everything it has stored, at once. The same screen asks Talyvor to delete all of the
          workspace&rsquo;s data and shows that request until it is done. In Track, a
          workspace&rsquo;s owner can delete it and restore it within 14 days.

        <p className="mt-3 text-reading text-muted">
          Deleting all of your data is carried out by an operator, not automatically, and no
