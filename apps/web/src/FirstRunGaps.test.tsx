//     link on a page for a product with a working checkout.

//     was routed to — the instructions for using the product, behind a nav item.
//  3. /specimen DOES NOT RESOLVE. The internal component gallery was unlinked but routable.

  // was inferred from config and never checked. Google's current documentation says of the
  // Testing state: "Exception: If the app only requests basic identity scopes (openid, email,
  // profile), any user can access without being on the allowlist" — and apps/bff/auth.go
  // requests exactly those three. Nobody is stopped at Google.
  //
  // The wall is OURS: OIDC_ALLOWED_EMAILS. So the guard worth keeping is not "never promise" —
  // it is "the promise must track the gate", asserted in BOTH directions, because a page that
  // can only ever say one thing is a page that will be wrong half the time.
