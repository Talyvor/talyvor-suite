/**
 * THE SIX REQUEST BODIES THIS BFF SENDS talyvor-lens, AND NOTHING ASKED talyvor-lens ABOUT THEM.
 *
 * `aiRequestBodyRegister.test.ts` next door does this for the five talyvor-docs bodies built from a
 * NAMED Go struct. Its own census put nine more marshalled bodies in an `anonymous` bucket it could
 * not name, pinned at a literal `9` with the sentence "none is in deploy/decision-expiry.sh today".
 * Six of those nine are key sets talyvor-lens binds. These are those six.
 *
 * ── THE MEASUREMENT THIS GUARD'S TEXT COMES FROM ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * The consequence sentences below are not reasoned from the code, they are EXECUTED. Every one of
 * these six lens handlers decodes with a plain `json.NewDecoder(req.Body).Decode(&in)` — NOT
 * `DisallowUnknownFields` — so a renamed key upstream is indistinguishable from an absent one and
 * the field takes its ZERO VALUE with the decode reporting success. What that zero value then DOES
 * was measured against talyvor-lens `f09348d1e3e1f090ff9de7ca245daeeec8656676`, in a read-only
 * `git archive` scratch export (that repo was held by tab-8d3f and was NEVER written to), by
 * driving lens' own code: the REAL `newProvisionHandler` over fakes for its two interfaces, and the
 * REAL downstream validators (`tenant.Store.CreateAPIKey`, `billing.AllowedTopUpCents`,
 * `economy.DualTokenStore.ConvertLENStoLXC`, `workspace.Manager.SetDistillPolicy` /
 * `SetCachePoolable`) for the five mounted as closures inside `main.go`. Nine cases, every verdict
 * PREDICTED BEFORE THE RUN and the harness failing on any mismatch:
 *
 *   route                              key               rename ⇒
 *   POST /v1/provision                 identity          LOUD    400 "identity required"
 *   POST /v1/provision                 ttl_hours         SILENT  200, session JWT 8h ⇒ 24h
 *   POST /v1/provision                 cache_poolable    SILENT  200, the choice never reaches
 *                                                                the manager; the default applies
 *   POST …/api-keys                    scopes            LOUD    refused AT ISSUANCE
 *   POST …/api-keys                    name              SILENT  key created with Name=""
 *   POST …/billing/checkout            usd_cents         LOUD    0 ∉ [1000 5000 10000]
 *   POST …/lxc/convert                 lxc_amount_ulxc   LOUD    0 < 100000 µLXC minimum
 *   PUT  …/distill                     distill_policy    SILENT  200, "disabled" ⇒ "always"
 *   PUT  …/cache-poolable              cache_poolable    SILENT  200, opted-in true ⇒ false
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THE MONEY ROUTES FAIL LOUD AND THE CONSENT ROUTES FAIL SILENT, WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHERE
 * THE ATTENTION HAS GONE. Both amounts are refused by an upstream allow-list or minimum, so a
 * renamed `usd_cents` or `lxc_amount_ulxc` is a 400 a person sees. Every route that records a
 * CHOICE — pooling consent, distill policy, session lifetime — answers 200 and stores something
 * else.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ AND THE SHARPEST ONE IS distill_policy, BECAUSE THE FAIL-SAFE IS AIMED AT THE WRONG SHAPE.
 * `normalizeDistillPolicy` has an explicit `default:` arm that resolves garbage to
 * `DistillDisabled` — its comment says "a misconfiguration never silently distills". A renamed key
 * does not produce garbage, it produces `""`, and `""` is the ONE value with its own arm:
 * `DefaultDistillPolicy`, which is `DistillAlways`. So the single input shape a cross-repo rename
 * can actually generate is the single shape that walks past the fail-safe, and a person who chose
 * "disabled" is recorded as "always".
 *
 * ⚠ ttl_hours IS A CREDENTIAL LIFETIME AND THE BFF CANNOT SEE THE CHANGE. `tenant.go` asks for 8h
 * and its comment says "Kept short: it is a session credential". `auth.ClampTTL(0)` returns
 * `DefaultTokenTTL` = 24h. The BFF reads `expires_at` off the response into `lensTokenExp`, so it
 * records the 24h faithfully — every layer agrees, and the credential lives three times as long as
 * the only file that states an intention asks for.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GUARD CLAIMS, PRECISELY ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The same one link the two sibling registers claim, and no more: the key set the deployer's
 * command asks talyvor-lens about is the key set this repository actually sends. It does NOT claim
 * any body matches its upstream — CI checks out this repository alone and nothing here can. Only
 * running the entry's command in a talyvor-lens checkout answers that, which is the entry's whole
 * job and why these exist at all.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, said out loud so the scope is not mistaken for coverage: a key renamed in
 * BOTH this repo and the register in one change is not a red here. From inside this repository that
 * is indistinguishable from a correct rename.
 *
 * ⚠ THE FLOORS ARE NOT DECORATION. Every half is parsed out of source, so a rename or a reformat
 * yields no match — at which point a set equality over two empty sets passes having read nothing.
 * Every body parse asserts its anchor occurs EXACTLY ONCE; the anonymous-marshal census is asserted
 * non-empty before it is partitioned; and the register is held to exactly as many lens entries as
 * this table has rows.

 * THAT MATTERS: they are ASKED ALREADY, by the `DocsPage` and `DocsSpace` MIRROR entries, which pin
 * those structs' whole json-tag sets. `content`, `content_text` and `workspace_id` are all members.
 * Nobody wrote that down, so the same entries were about to be added twice — and, worse, the
 * coverage is INCIDENTAL: it holds only because Docs binds the RESPONSE struct on those paths.
 *
 * ⚠ WHICH IS WHY THE PREMISE IS NOW PINNED FOR THE AUTHZ ONE. `apps/bff/lens.go#docsSpaceCreateBody`
 * overwrites `workspace_id` with the SESSION's workspace and forwards every other key VERBATIM —
 * measured, not read: `{"name":"Eng","ws_id":"ws-ATTACKER"}` comes out as
 * `{"name":"Eng","workspace_id":"ws-SESSION","ws_id":"ws-ATTACKER"}`. So a Docs create handler that

 *
 * ⚠⚠ THIS RULE PARTITIONS THE WHOLE TABLE AND DOES NOT FILTER IT, BECAUSE ITS FIRST VERSION FILTERED
 * AND CONTROL Z4 CAUGHT IT. That version took its population from rows matching the word `ASKED` in
 * the very prose it was policing, with a `> 0` floor. Rewording ONE row's `ASKED` to `COVERED` left
 * the floor satisfied by the other row and dropped the reworded one OUT of the population entirely —
 * its coverage claim then went unchecked with NOTHING RED (measured: 0 failures). That is the
 * silently-emptied scope this repository has already found twice (formatterReach's rule B, the
 * docsSearchTypes map). Every row is classified now, the two buckets must ACCOUNT FOR ALL THREE, and
