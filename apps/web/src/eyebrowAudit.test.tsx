/**
 * THE EYEBROW RULE, FROM BOTH SIDES.
 *
 * The running audit in eyebrowAudit.ts reads the DOM every test renders. This file holds the two
 * things that audit cannot supply about itself:
 *
 *  1. THE PREDICATE, EXERCISED ON FIXTURES. The offender rule is SILENT while the product is
 *     correct, which is the same output a blinded predicate produces. Every assertion below runs
 *     on a hand-built fixture, so it stays meaningful in exactly the state the running audit
 *     cannot be trusted in. This is the direction the floor cannot see: `satisfiesEyebrowFloor` is
 *     computed from a SEPARATE walk that asks for the transform directly, so blinding
 *     `eyebrowOffendersIn` leaves the floor green — one catcher each, neither alone.
 *
 *  2. THE SOURCE HALF, WHICH NEEDS NO FIXTURE. `check-audit-reach.mjs` fails CI when an exported
 *     component is never rendered, so the DOM audit's reach is enforced per COMPONENT — but not
 *     per BRANCH. Measured at `ff17b41`: two of the 14 rendered eyebrow shapes appear only TWICE
 *     in the whole suite, so they hang on one fixture each, and a `cond ? …` arm nobody renders is
 *     invisible to the DOM entirely. The source rule reads the literal and closes that.
