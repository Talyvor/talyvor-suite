/**
 * A CLASS THAT IS NOT A CLASS.
 *
 * `local/no-arbitrary-value` stops a component from BYPASSING the design system. It cannot
 * see the opposite failure: a class that looks like a token, reads like a token in review,
 * and generates no CSS whatsoever. Tailwind does not warn — an unrecognised candidate is
 * simply not emitted — so the element renders unstyled and nobody notices, because nothing
 * anywhere is red.
 *
 * ⚠ IT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED, TWICE, AND FOR A LONG TIME:
 *
 *   `text-mono`  ×7 — there is no `mono` in the fontSize scale (the family utility is
 *                     `font-mono`). Landing.tsx's Figure even carried the comment "Mono and
 *                     tabular" while never once rendering in mono, and Setup.tsx set five
 *                     identifiers and a whole <pre> of shell snippets in the body sans.
 *   `bg-bg`      ×1 — there is no `bg` colour token. Setup.tsx's code block had no
 *                     background at all: a bordered box the same colour as the card.
 *
 * Both were found by reading the EMITTED stylesheet rather than the source — `.text-mono`
 * and `.bg-bg` produce zero rules in dist/assets/index-*.css. This test is that check, made
 * automatic: Tailwind is run over the real config and the real content, and every class
 * token the source actually writes must appear in what Tailwind produced.
 *
 * Dead ⟺ Tailwind saw the token as a candidate and emitted nothing for it. There is no
 * namespace modelling here and there deliberately isn't any: the generator is the authority
 * on what is a utility, not a table in a test that would drift from it.

/**
 * Class tokens the source actually writes, from two harvests with different rules.
 *
 * ⚠ SCOPE WAS THE FIRST THING THIS GOT WRONG, TWICE, IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
 *
 * Reading only `className=` / `cn(...)` — the surface `local/no-arbitrary-value` reads —
 * misses every class held in a LOOKUP TABLE, and that is where a design system keeps its
 * most important ones: `Button`'s variants, `Pill`'s statuses, `MuNumeral`'s unit ticks are
 * module-level records reached by `cn(base, table[key])`. Blind to the whole component layer.
 *
 * Reading every string literal instead reports English. "a alongside", "an and",
 * `'auth-me'`, `'2-digit'`, `'claude-code'` — prose and API paths are full of hyphens, and a
 * guard that cries wolf once is a guard someone deletes.
 *
 * So:
 *   A. In a CLASS POSITION (`className=`, `class=`, `cn`/`clsx`/`cva`/… arguments) every
 *      token is harvested. A lone dead class in an attribute — `className="text-mono"` —
 *      is only visible here.
 *   B. ANYWHERE ELSE a literal is harvested only if at least one of its tokens is a class
 *      Tailwind actually emitted. Self-calibrating: a variant table always contains real
 *      classes, a sentence never does. No prefix table to drift.

/**
 * THE SWEEP'S OTHER INPUT: WHICH FILES IT READS, AND IT WAS THE UNCONTROLLED ONE.
 *
 * The generator is asked rather than a table, and that half is controlled above on known answers
 * in both directions. The other half is `collectUsedTokens`, and its FIRST decision is which
 * files to open. Nothing controlled that, and this sweep's output for "read nothing" is
 * byte-identical to its output for "read everything and found no dead class": `[]`.
 *
 * MEASURED at db85e4d on the real tree, not reasoned about
 * (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-blindwalk-controls-9e73.py` and `w11-blindwalk-armed-9e73.py`, every
 * mutation anchor-count-asserted before the edit, restored in a `finally` and verified back by
 * sha256, verdicts read from vitest's own per-test lines):
 *   A1  `text-mono` — the exact shape that shipped seven times, and which this file exists to
 *       catch — put into a real screen at `areas/lens/Ledger.tsx`: REDS `every class the source
 *       writes is a class Tailwind emits`, and only that case. The comparison is armed on real
 *       production files.
 *   A2  THE HOLE: the same dead class, plus ONE line so the walk does not descend into `areas` —
 *       rc=0, GREEN. 43 of the 70 production files under apps/web/src live there, which is every
 *       product screen — including `Setup.tsx` and `Landing.tsx`, where BOTH original defects were.
 *   C3  the skip ALONE, no dead class: GREEN. Nothing anywhere notices the population shrank.
 *
 * That is #183's C1/C2/C3, in this file. #183 closed it in `lib/awaiting.test.ts` and named the
 * three sweeps it had not been run against; this is one of them.
 *
 * THE REPAIR IS #183's AND IT IS THRESHOLD-FREE — an INDEPENDENT ENUMERATION, not a bigger floor.
 * The `>150` floor below is already substantive and is satisfied by the 27 files that survive the
 * skip, so raising a number would be a threshold nobody measured. `import.meta.glob` is resolved
 * by Vite at transform time and touches `node:fs` not at all, so a skip map, a changed extension
 * filter or a wrong `roots` cannot move both instruments the same way. Compared BOTH DIRECTIONS,
 * with a floor for the one failure that CAN move both: an anchor resolving to an empty tree
 * leaves the two enumerations agreeing on nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ IT PASSED ON ITS FIRST RUN, so every assertion in it has its own control and every verdict is
 * read from the FAILING TEST NAME rather than from the file's exit code
 * (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-blindwalk-guard-controls-9e73.py`, 7/7):
 *   P1 walk skips `areas/` → the SET comparison reds and it is the ONLY newly-failing case, so the
 *      catch is this block's and not something else noticing.
 *   P2 the glob pattern pointed at a directory that does not exist → the FLOOR *and* the SET red,
 *      so the floor is armed rather than decorative.
 *   P3 the walk widened to keep `.test.*` → the SET reds AS EXPECTED, and it also reds the sweep
 *      below. ⚠ RECORDED RATHER THAN PREDICTED AWAY, and it is a coupling worth knowing: the
 *      generator control above hands Tailwind `text-mono bg-bg text-nonesuch-9` — three classes it
 *      asserts are NOT emitted — inside a `class=` attribute. Widening the walk pulls this file
 *      into its own swept population and those fixtures report as dead classes, which is the right
 *      answer for the wrong reason. The sweep is kept off its own negative controls by the walk's
 *      test-file exclusion and by NOTHING ELSE.
 *   P4 the `text-mono` defect with the walk intact → the ORIGINAL guard reds ALONE and the SET
 *      stays green, so the repair was ADDED to the sweep rather than swapped in for it.
 *   P5 the A2 combination → CAUGHT. The flip is the finding.
 *   P6 BLINDING: this block skipped and the A2 defect restored → rc=0, NOT CAUGHT. Nothing else
 *      in the repo was watching.
 *   G1 a new production file that both instruments can see → STAYS GREEN. It is a set comparison,
 *      not a snapshot of a file list somebody would have to re-baseline.
 *
 * ⚠ `walkStyles` ABOVE IS A SECOND WALK AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT GUARDED HERE, because it fails
 * in the opposite direction. It builds the hand-written-CSS ALLOWLIST: a walk that reads fewer
 * files hands the sweep fewer excuses, so a class defined in a missed `<style>` block is reported
 * as dead. That is a loud false positive, not a silent pass — the failure mode this block exists
 * for cannot happen through it.
