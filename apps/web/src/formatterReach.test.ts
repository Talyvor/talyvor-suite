/**
 * A CLASSIFIED FORMATTER THAT NOTHING CALLS — the half of figureFace.test.ts's rule B that
 * rule B cannot state about itself.
 *
 * figureFace.test.ts rule B asks "is every exported `format*` CLASSIFIED as a figure or not?".
 * It never asks whether anything RENDERS it. Its own table says so in a comment against
 * `areas/track/format.ts#formatUSD`: "A FIGURE BY ITS OUTPUT, AND NOTHING RENDERS IT — so this
 * entry is classified honestly and enforced by nothing." A classification nothing can falsify is
 * a sentence, not a guard, and this file is the instrument that makes the reach half checkable.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED 2026-08-10 at `2bee9fc`, whole suite green (1020 tests): THREE of the SIX exported
 * `format*` in the product had ZERO production call sites. The handover named one of them.
 *
 *     apps/web/src/areas/lens/format.ts#formatUSD      3   BillingReturn, Overview, TopUp
 *     apps/web/src/areas/lens/format.ts#formatWhen     3   Keys, Ledger, Overview
 *     apps/web/src/areas/lens/topupApi.ts#formatCents  2   BillingReturn, TopUp
 *     apps/web/src/areas/track/format.ts#formatUSD     0   ← a money rule nobody calls
 *     apps/web/src/areas/track/format.ts#formatWhen    0
 *     packages/ui/src/lib/format.ts#formatDay          0   ← and it is public API
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THE MONEY ONE WAS A DEFECT AND NOT MERELY DEAD. `areas/track/format.ts` exported,
 * documented ("Track's reconciled per-issue AI cost") and unit-TESTED a `formatUSD` that rounds
 * to cents, while the one screen rendering `ai_cost_usd` used a LOCAL `costLabel` that does not.
 * They disagree on every value below half a cent ($0.00 vs $0.0004) and at zero ($0.00 vs "No AI
 * spend recorded"). The exported, documented, tested one is the one the next developer finds.
 * It is now `formatCost` — the SHIPPED rule, exported, with the dead namesake deleted.
 *
 * ⚠ A NAME-KEYED INSTRUMENT CANNOT MEASURE THIS, AND MINE DID IT WRONG FIRST. A grep for
 * `formatUSD` credits track's dead export with lens's three call sites — the very collision that
 * defeated rule B's census before it was re-keyed to `module#name`. Reach here is resolved
 * through the IMPORT GRAPH, and `LIVE_FLOOR` below is the hardcoded proof that the two
 * same-named `formatUSD` do not answer for each other.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT "REACHED" MEANS HERE, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED. A named import (`import { x } from`)
 * from a non-test module other than the declaring one. Deliberately NOT counted:
 *   · a bare re-export — `packages/ui/src/index.ts` re-exports `formatDay` and calls nothing;
 *     counting it would make every public export permanently "reached".
 *   · a namespace import — `reachRegistry.ts` does `import * as UI from '@talyvor/ui'` to
 *     ENUMERATE exports for the reach audit. Counting it would mark every `@talyvor/ui` export
 *     reached by the audit harness that exists to measure reach. Rule C pins the namespace
 *     importers so a real component adopting that form fails here rather than hiding a caller.
 * An import THROUGH the barrel IS counted against the declaring module — see `resolveBarrel`.

 * nothing else changed, this file stayed GREEN (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-stoppedwalk-controls-4b2e.py`).
 *
 * ⚠ AND A STOPPED WALK IS THE FAILURE THIS FILE'S RULE INVERTS INTO A FALSE ACCUSATION, not

 * fails LOUDLY and in the wrong direction, and the reader would be told to delete working code.
 *
 * `import.meta.glob` is resolved by Vite at TRANSFORM time and touches `node:fs` not at all, so a
 * wrong root, a changed extension filter or a walk that stops descending cannot move both
 * enumerations the same way. Compared BOTH DIRECTIONS.
 *
 * ⚠ THE CALL IS LITERAL ON PURPOSE. Vite rewrites `import.meta.glob` by matching the SYNTAX at
 * transform time; hoisting the patterns into a variable typechecks and then dies at runtime.
 * ⚠ AND TESTS ARE NOT FILTERED OUT HERE, unlike every other file in this class — `allSources`
 * deliberately KEEPS them and flags them `test`, because "imported only by its own unit test" is
 * a verdict this file reports and it cannot reach it from a corpus with the tests removed.

/**
 * THE MODULES WHOSE WHOLE EXPORTED SURFACE EXISTS TO BE CALLED BY A SCREEN.
 *
 * ⚠ IT IS NOT `FORMATTER_MODULES` ANY MORE, AND THE RENAME IS THE FINDING. Three of these are
 * presentation vocabulary; `areas/track/data.ts` is QUERY SEMANTICS, and calling it a formatter
 * module to get it in scope would have been a lie in a constant name. What the four share is the
 * only property this file needs: a human already declared that the module exists to be called
 * from somewhere else, so every export of it is in scope whatever it is called.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED AT `7474125`, EVERY GATE GREEN — the Track data layer had THREE exports with zero
 * production importers, and this file could not see one of them:
 *
 *     areas/track/data.ts#filterIssues    imported ONLY by data.test.ts, which carries 5 tests
 *                                         for it — and the screen that finally shipped the live
 *                                         list REFUSED client-side filtering in writing
 *                                         ("a control that narrowed only the rows already
 *                                         fetched would be a filter that lies about what it
 *                                         searched"), so the caller it was kept for was written
 *                                         and chose not to call it
 *     areas/track/data.ts#IssueFilters    its parameter type, and INVISIBLE to this file — see
 *                                         the stated limit on `declaredFormatters`
 *     areas/track/data.ts#useTrackProbe   imported by NOTHING, in any file, test or not
 *
 * ⚠ AND `export class` WAS INVISIBLE TOO, WHICH IS HOW A FIFTH DEFECT SAT AT THE TOP OF THAT
 * MODULE. `TrackApiError extends Error` was exported, area-named and constructed by nothing
 * (#172). The declaration matchers below read `export function` and `export const` only, so a
 * whole KIND of export was outside a rule whose whole subject is exports. It reads classes now.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE STILL CANNOT SEE, stated rather than implied: `export interface` and
 * `export type`. A dead type is a weaker hazard than a dead value — nothing can call it and it
 * emits no code — but it is not zero, and `IssueFilters` above is the instance.
 *
 * ⚠ THE `format*` NAME SHAPE WATCHED A DEFECT HAPPEN AND COULD NOT SEE IT. Until `63534de`,
 * `areas/track/format.ts#priorityLabel` was exported, documented and unit-tested against
 * model.IssuePriority with ZERO production call sites, while IssueDetail hand-rolled a second
 * copy of the same five labels for the control that ships — and the Status control beside it
 * rendered the RAW enum while the pill rendered `statusLabel`. Every name in that sentence is a
 * `*Label`, so this file was structurally blind to all of it.
 *
 * ⚠ THE HANDOVER SAID WIDENING THIS NEEDED "A RULE FOR WHAT COUNTS AS A FORMATTER". MEASURED,
 * IT DOES NOT — that framing is what kept the hole open for four sessions. A MODULE is a
 * declaration a human already made: three of these files exist to turn stored values into words
 * and the fourth exists to shape a query, so every export of them is in scope whatever it is
 * called, and no general definition of "formatter" has to be invented. The name rule is kept
 * alongside rather than replaced, so `topupApi.ts#formatCents` — a formatter that lives outside
 * the audited modules — keeps its coverage.
 *
 * Widening added ZERO pins: measured at `63534de`, all five newly-visible exports
 * (`statusLabel`, `priorityLabel`, `PRIORITY_VALUES`, `ledgerStatus`, `humanizeType`) have
 * production call sites. That is not an assumption — rule B proves they are DECLARED in scope and
 * rule A proves the zero-reach set is still exactly the two pins, so all five are reached.
 *
 * ⚠ THE WIDENED RULE PASSED ON ITS FIRST RUN, SO IT WAS CONTROLLED BOTH WAYS.
 *   W1  re-inline the priority vocabulary in IssueDetail, so `priorityLabel` and
 *       `PRIORITY_VALUES` lose their ONLY call sites -> rule A reds, naming both by
 *       `module#name`, and it is the ONLY failure in 1052: `issueVocabulary.test.tsx` stays
 *       green because the re-inlined labels still AGREE. Nothing else in this repo can see a
 *       vocabulary export go dead.
 *   W2  drop one path from AUDITED_MODULES -> rule B reds and RULE A STAYS GREEN. That is the
 *       measured blindness B exists for: A compares two sets that both shrink together.
