/**
 * EVERY SECTION TITLE BEHIND THE GATE WAS A `<div>`, ON PAGES WITH UP TO NINE OF THEM.
 *
 * `a19c18f` (#126) measured that the signed-in console rendered ZERO heading elements and fixed
 * it by promoting the page name to `<h1>`. It stopped there. MEASURED IN REAL CHROME on the
 * built artifact at `397b11d`, one level down, across the ten top-level gated addresses:
 *
 *     address     heading elements     cards on the page
 *     /                   1                   6
 *     /setup              1                   9
 *     /spend              1                   3
 *     /settings           1                   2
 *     /ledger /billing /keys /members /track /docs   1 each, 1 card each
 *
 * Forty elements carry `text-head` — the token whose own definition in preset.ts reads "a card
 * header and the shell title bar". Ten are the page `<h1>`, ten are the sidebar wordmark, and
 * the remaining TWENTY are card headers. Not one of them was a heading element. So on /setup, a
 * screen-reader user pressing H got "Setup" and then nothing, on a page with nine titled
 * sections; the headings rotor listed one entry for the whole screen.
 *
 * ⚠ THE PRODUCT HAD ALREADY DECIDED THE ANSWER, ON THE PAGES A STRANGER SEES. `legalParts.tsx`
 * writes its section titles `<h2 className="text-head text-ink">`, which is why the same census
 * reads `1>2>2>2>2>2>2>2` on /privacy and `1>2>2>…` on /terms while every screen behind the gate
 * reads `1`. The rule is this product's own; it had been applied to the two legal documents and
 * to nothing else.
 *
 * ⚠ ONE SEAM, THIRTY-NINE CALL SITES. Every card header in the console goes through
 * `CardHeader` in packages/ui — Card.tsx emitted one `<div className="text-head text-ink">` and
 * that div is on 39 call sites across Lens, Track and Docs. The fix is the element, not the
 * classes: preflight sets `h1,…,h6{font-size:inherit;font-weight:inherit}` and `…{margin:0}`,
 * which is exactly why #126's promotion was byte-identical, and it is why this one is too.
 *
 * ⚠ `text-head` IS NOT THE RULE, AND THE LAST TWO CASES REFUSE THE OBVIOUS OVER-CORRECTION.
 * Two other things wear that token and neither is a section title: the sidebar wordmark
 * ("Talyvor", a brand mark that names the product, not a region) and `MuNumeral`'s whole-number
 * span (a FIGURE — a heading element around a balance would put "2,350" in the rotor). A sweep
 * written as "everything carrying text-head is a heading" would pass this file's other cases and
 * be wrong; it is asserted from the other side instead.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ AND THAT REFUSAL TOOK TWO DRAFTS, BOTH CAUGHT BY CONTROLS RATHER THAN BY READING.
 * The first was `querySelectorAll('span.text-head')` asserting each was a SPAN — constant-true,
 * because the moment one BECAME a heading it left the selector and the loop ran over what was
 * left. The second was a heading COUNT at `/`, which is not dodgeable — and still scored 0 red,
 * because this file's BFF fake 404s the balance reads, so no `MuNumeral` renders at ANY address
 * here. An address-shaped assertion cannot see a component the fixture never mounts. The figure
 * is rendered directly for that reason, and the count is over the render.
 *
 * ⚠ NOT CLAIMED, AND NOT MEASURED: whether a card header should ever be an `h3`. On
 * `/track/issues/<id>` the outline now reads h1 → h2 → h2 → h2 → h2 — the issue title and then
 * its three cards, which are sections OF that issue and would be h3 in an outline that named
 * the relationship. No level is SKIPPED, which is the defect ConsoleDeepHeading.test.tsx exists
 * to catch and still catches; the cards simply sit beside the title rather than under it.
 * Giving `CardHeader` a level is an API decision across 39 call sites and is not made here.

 * header — and nothing said so, because nothing could.
