/**
 * THE CONSOLE HEADER NAMES THE PAGE YOU ARE ON — INCLUDING WHEN YOU ARE ON NONE OF THEM.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MEASURED, AT `c9e1e8a`, WITH EVERY GATE GREEN ───────────────────────────
 *
 * `App.tsx` carried TWO tables of paths that had to agree, and nothing asked whether they did:
 * the `<Routes>` list, and `titleFor()`'s own copy. They disagreed on every address that has
 * no page. Eight were driven through the real `<App />`; eight titled as a page:
 *
 *   /admin · /admin/certificates · /specimen · /nonesuch · /keys/extra → "Overview"
 *   /billingx → "Billing"   /trackers → "Track"   /docs-old → "Docs"
 *
 * Two mechanisms, both rendered:
 *   · `titleFor` ended `return exact[pathname] ?? 'Overview'`, so EVERY unmatched address
 *     titled as Overview. At /admin — the retired operator console `AdminRemoved.test.tsx`
 *     exists because someone still has it bookmarked — the console said, at one instant:
 *       header   "Overview"                 (a page you are not on)
 *       sidebar  nothing `aria-current`     (no page at all)
 *       body     "Nothing at this address — pick a section from the sidebar."
 *     Three signals, one false, and the false one is the only NAME on the screen. To a screen
 *     reader arriving at the banner landmark, it is the page.
 *   · `pathname.startsWith('/billing')` is true of `/billingx`, which routes to the catch-all.
 *     A prefix test is not the router's matcher and never was.
 *
 * ⚠ `AdminRemoved.test.tsx` ALREADY RENDERS /admin AND PASSES. It pins the body message and
 * each invented hostname by name — the strings someone thought of — and never asks what the
 * header says. That is the #91 shape (a curated list guards what it lists), one file away.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS READS THE RENDERED BANNER ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The fix unifies the two tables into `CONSOLE_ROUTES`, which makes "every route has a title"
 * true BY CONSTRUCTION — so a test that asks that table about itself would pass for every value
 * of it. This drives `<App />` to each address and reads the string the banner actually paints.
 * It was red 8/20 on the code it was written against.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE NAMES ARE PINNED AS LITERALS BELOW, not read from the table. Driving the render
 * loop off `CONSOLE_ROUTES` is what makes a NEW route audited automatically; it is also what
 * would let a renamed page rename its own expectation. `PINNED` is the second half: the table
 * must equal it exactly, in both directions, so adding a page without naming it here fails.
