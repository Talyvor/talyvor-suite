/**
 * THE THREE TRACK WRITE BODIES — THE HALF `aiRequestBodyRegister.test.ts` NAMES AS A BOUNDARY
 * AND CANNOT SEE BY CONSTRUCTION.
 *
 * Next door's census derives its population from `json.Marshal(<Name>{` across `apps/bff`. That
 * finds every body this repository AUTHORS in Go. It cannot find these three, and the reason is
 * structural rather than an oversight: `trackCreateIssue`, `trackUpdateIssue` and the POST half of
 * `trackIssueComments` pass the caller's own `r.Body` straight to `forwardProduct`, so no Go struct
 * in this repository ever names their keys. The BROWSER authors them. That file says so in as many
 * words — the six verbatim forwards are "named as a BOUNDARY rather than left to read as coverage"
 * — and this file is the track half of that boundary.
 *
 * ── THE FINDING: THESE THREE ARE NOT ONE RISK CLASS, AND THE MAJORITY OF THE KEYS SIT ON THE
 *    ONLY SILENT ONE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * MEASURED read-only against talyvor-track `3672af1a1f3936b4079cf88ea72f3e0db3136520`, in a
 * `git archive` scratch export — that repo is held by another tab and was NEVER written to, and
 * no fetch was run in it. All three routes decode through the SAME helper, `httpx.DecodeJSON`,
 * which calls `dec.DisallowUnknownFields()`. Reading that line alone says "a renamed key is a 400
 * everywhere" and that conclusion is WRONG for the route that matters most:
 *
 *   POST  /issues                 → `var body createBody`        (a STRUCT)  → rename = 400 BAD_JSON
 *   POST  /issues/{id}/comments   → `var in model.Comment`       (a STRUCT)  → rename = 400 BAD_JSON
 *   PATCH /issues/{id}            → `var updates map[string]any` (a MAP)     → rename = 200, UNCHANGED
 *
 * ⚠ `DisallowUnknownFields` HAS NO EFFECT ON A MAP DESTINATION. encoding/json enforces it for
 * struct fields only; a map accepts every key. Measured rather than read, with the flag toggled as
 * its own control so the struct result could not be a property of the type:
 *
 *     struct + {"title":"x"}    flag ON  → nil
 *     struct + {"headline":"x"} flag ON  → json: unknown field "headline"
 *     map    + {"state":"x"}    flag ON  → nil, map[state:x]          ← the key sails through
 *     struct + {"headline":"x"} flag OFF → nil                        ← control: the flag is why
 *
 * and the key that sails through is then dropped WITHOUT A WORD by `issue.Store.Update`:
 *
 *     for k, v := range updates {
 *         if _, ok := updatableFields[k]; !ok && k != "completed_at" { continue }
 *     ...
 *     if len(setClauses) == 0 { return s.getInWorkspace(ctx, id, workspaceID) }
 *
 * — a patch whose every key is unknown runs NO statement and answers 200 with the issue as it
 * already was. The browser then does exactly the diligent thing and it makes the failure worse:
 * `IssueDetail.tsx#patch` invalidates `['track-issue', id]` on success and re-reads, so the screen
 * confidently redraws the OLD value under a control the reader just moved. There is no status
 * code, no error body and no response field separating that from a correct edit.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL AND UPSTREAM HAS ALREADY PAID FOR IT ONCE. The comment sitting inside
 * `updatableFields` records the same defect in the same map: "The column this allowlist's silence
 * made unwritable. Update drops any key that is not here WITHOUT a word, so
 * `PATCH {"milestone_id": "..."}` answered 200 with the field untouched — indistinguishable, to a
 * caller, from a stored value."
 *
 * ⚠ AND FOUR OF THE SIX KEYS THIS APP SENDS ARE ON THAT ROUTE — `status`, `description`,
 * `priority`, `assignee_id`. The two loud routes carry one key each (`title`, `body`). A guard
 * written for "the track write bodies" as one thing would have been right about the two that
 * announce their own failure and wrong about the one that does not.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GUARD CLAIMS, PRECISELY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does NOT claim any body matches talyvor-track — nothing in this repository can, because CI
 * checks out this repository alone. It claims the same ONE link the two registers next door claim:
 * the key set the deployer's command asks talyvor-track about is the key set this app actually
 * sends. An entry naming a stale set settles the wrong question and reports a pass for it.
 *
 * Both halves are derived from source. The population is read out of `apps/bff/track.go` (a fourth
 * verbatim forward with no row here is a red — the completeness direction whose absence WAS the
 * hole next door), and each row's key set is read out of the browser files that build the body, so
 * a control added to a screen without a register update is a red rather than a silent widening.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, said out loud so scope is not mistaken for coverage. A key renamed in BOTH
 * this repo and the register in one change still agrees with itself. Only running the register's
 * command in a talyvor-track checkout tells that apart, which is what the `cannot` entries are for
 * and why they are UNCHECKABLE here rather than passes.
