/**
 * THE RENDERED-PLACEHOLDER AUDIT — the one text in the product that is painted by the browser.
 *
 * `Input.tsx` declares `placeholder:text-faint`. Nothing has ever asked whether a field that is
 * NOT an `<Input>` declares anything, and the answer is that a bare `<input placeholder="…">`
 * gets its placeholder from the USER AGENT.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED IN A REAL ENGINE, not reasoned about (Chrome 151, computed `::placeholder` colour on
 * the real token values, `color-scheme` set for each theme):
 *
 *     token placeholder   rgb(90,110,133)  light   rgb(107,127,150)  dark   ← --faint, both themes
 *     UA placeholder      rgb(117,117,117) light   rgb(117,117,117)  dark   ← CHROME'S GREY
 *
 * The UA colour is BYTE-IDENTICAL IN BOTH THEMES. It is not derived from `currentColor` (the
 * element's own colour, `ink` in each theme, measured beside it) and it is not composited
 * — `::placeholder` opacity is 1 — so it is a flat neutral grey with none of the palette's blue
 * undertone, painted the same on the light canvas and the dark one.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT FAILS THE FLOOR THIS REPO ALREADY HOLDS EVERY TEXT TOKEN TO. `contrast.test.ts` scores
 * every text token against every background at AA body (4.5:1) and exists because `faint` at
 * 2.98:1 "had been shipping". Scored with that same instrument, on `bg-canvas`, which is what all
 * three offenders sit on:
 *
 *     UA grey         on canvas   4.25:1 light   4.30:1 dark   ← BELOW 4.5:1 IN BOTH THEMES
 *     --faint (token) on canvas   4.84:1 light   4.81:1 dark
 *
 * So the guard that proves the palette clears AA proves it about TOKENS, and this text is not a
 * token. A curated pair list cannot ask "is there text on screen wearing no token at all" — that
 * is the #91 lesson, in the one property whose value the DOM does not carry.
 *
 * ── WHY IT READS THE DOM ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A source rule would have to decide, at each `placeholder=` site, whether the element is a raw
 * `<input>` or an `<Input>` that spreads the prop through to one — `Keys.tsx:114` passes
 * `placeholder={k.key_prefix}` to the component, so the attribute and the class list are written
 * in two different files. Measured: 5 `placeholder=` sites in the source, 2 of them on the
 * component. The DOM is where the attribute and the class meet, which is the same argument
 * focusAudit.ts makes for `asChild`.
 *
 * ⚠ THE CLASS MUST BE THE ELEMENT'S OWN, and that is a fact about CSS rather than a choice:
 * `placeholder:text-faint` compiles to `.placeholder\:text-faint::placeholder{color:…}`, which
 * matches nothing but that element's own pseudo-element. An ancestor carrying it does not reach a
 * descendant's placeholder, so — unlike the figure face, where `font-figure` inherits and the
 * audit walks up the tree — walking up here would report a green that the browser does not paint.
 * Pinned by a unit test and by control C6.

// last-registered-first, so an `afterEach` DOM scan reads an EMPTY BODY and reports every surface
// clean.
//
// ⚠ THIS ONE ALSO OBSERVES `attributes`, WHICH THE OTHER FOUR DO NOT, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE
// SUBJECT: a placeholder is an ATTRIBUTE. A field whose placeholder is swapped in place — same
// element, no child and no text node touched — is a mutation the other audits' filter does not
// deliver, and this audit would never re-read it. `attributeFilter` keeps it to the two attributes
// that can change the answer rather than every attribute in the tree.

 * THE FLOOR — the files that must have audited a placeholder, and what each renders.
 *
 * ⚠ IT ASKS FOR A PLACEHOLDER, NOT FOR AN OFFENDER. A rule whose only output is a list of
 * offenders passes perfectly when it sees nothing at all — a dead observer, a fixture that stopped
 * mounting the form, a key that never matches. Measured: with the observer never installed, every
 * offender rule in this repo goes green and this table is the only thing that goes red.
 *
 * ⚠ KEYED BY THE PATH VITEST REPORTS (`src/areas/lens/Keys.test.tsx`), NOT BY BASENAME. #101's C3
 * found MUST_AUDIT_MONO_TEXT keyed by basename against a full-path lookup: every entry returned
 * undefined and the floor had never fired once. Control C4 is what proves these keys, by blinding
 * the observer and requiring these exact files to be the ones that red.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH, MEASURED RATHER THAN REASONED ABOUT. C8's first form deleted ONE of
 * DocsArea.test.tsx's two placeholders and came back **NOT CAUGHT**: SpaceView's field still
 * renders into that file, so the entry stays satisfied and SpaceList is silently guarded by
 * nothing. That is not a hole to be patched, it is what a floor IS — `0292cf0` recorded the
 * identical shape for MUST_RENDER_QUANTITY, where every listed file kept rendering some OTHER
 * quantity. A FLOOR ASKS "did this file audit one of these", NEVER "did it audit THIS one". The
 * catcher for a single fixture losing its field is the surface test that asserts the field, not
 * this table, and C8 now deletes both so it tests the claim actually being made.
