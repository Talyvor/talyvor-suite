// EmptyStates.test.tsx — EVERY EMPTY STATE IS ENUMERATED FROM THE SOURCE AND MUST NAME A NEXT ACTION.
//
// THE DEFECT. A new signup sees empty states before it sees anything else, and this product's
// empty states describe an ABSENCE: "No members in this workspace yet." True on every new
// workspace, and it leaves the reader unable to tell working from broken from waiting-on-me.
// Two of them were fixed by hand (Overview's earnings and activity rows) and pinned in
// ClaimsAudit.test.tsx — as TWO NAMED STRINGS.
//
// ⚠ WHY THAT PINNING WAS NOT ENOUGH, AND WHY THIS FILE ENUMERATES INSTEAD. A curated list of
// strings guards the strings someone thought of. It said nothing about the seven other empty
// states shipping in the same app, and it would say nothing about the eighth. The same trap was
// closed twice already in this project by making the CODE the input rather than a list: the
// dead-class sweep asks Tailwind which classes are real, and the compose reach guard enumerates
// variables from config instead of from a curated array. This does that for copy — it finds the
// empty states itself and refuses to pass on one nobody classified.
//
// ⚠ WHAT AN EMPTY STATE OWES THE READER, which is the rule applied below: it must say what would
// PUT something here, and where that is done. "Correct and unhelpful" is the failure mode; a
// sentence that only restates the emptiness is a sentence the user cannot act on.

// ⚠ THE POPULATION WAS A WHITELIST AND IT MISSED A REAL SURFACE — MEASURED, NOT SUSPECTED.
// This read `const SCANNED = ['areas', 'components']` under the prose "Surfaces only. routes/ is
// legal copy and lib/ has no JSX", i.e. it stated an EXCLUSION and implemented an INCLUSION. The
// two are not the same boundary and one real surface fell in the gap: `apps/web/src/App.tsx`
// renders the catch-all "Nothing at this address — pick a section from the sidebar." — an empty
// state by this file's own detector, in neither routes/ nor lib/, and no rule here had ever been
// applied to it. Found by RECORDING every path this test opens (`node:fs` wrapped inside the
// vitest worker, `~/talyvor-queue/w11-population-census-4b2e.py`) rather than by reading the walk:
// 33 of the 102 production files under the two roots, and the walk's source says nothing about
// which 69 it never reached.
//
// ⚠ A PRUNE COULD NOT HAVE FOUND THIS AND THE DISTINCTION IS THE WHOLE POINT. Every census in
// this class deleted part of the tree and asked who reddened. A file that was NEVER in the
// population cannot be deleted from it, so the realistic rot — a screen landing under a path the
// walk does not reach — is invisible to that instrument. Measured directly instead
// (`... 4b2e.py handed arrival`): a new file at `apps/web/src/panels/CostPanel.tsx`, the exact
// shape areas/ components/ routes/ lib/ already have, was opened by SIX of the eight sweeps in
// this class and by neither this one nor emptyVsFault.test.ts.
//
// THE FIX IS THE INVERSION, NOT A SIXTH DIRECTORY NAME. The boundary is now what the prose always
// said — everything the product ships, minus exclusions that each carry their reason — so a new
// top-level directory is IN by default and a new EXCLUSION is what has to be argued for. Adding
// `'panels'` to a list would have armed the rule for panels/ and left the next directory exactly
// as blind, which is the shape tab-3a6d measured across this whole class.

// ⚠ EACH EXCLUSION IS A CLAIM AND EACH WAS RE-MEASURED, because two of them turned out not to be
// doing what their reason said.
//   · routes/  LOAD-BEARING. The detector really does fire four times there and all four are
//              legal prose, not empty states: Terms' "No refund policy exists in the code or in
//              this document.", Privacy's "Nothing else leaves.", and two more. Confirmed by
//              running this file's own EMPTY_STATE over routes/ — see the control at the bottom,
//              which pins one of them so the exclusion cannot go stale silently.
//   · lib/     INERT, and shipped saying so. `apps/web/src/lib` and `packages/ui/src/lib` hold
//              ZERO `.tsx` files, so a `.tsx`-only walk never reached them and this name has
//              never excluded anything. It stays because lib/ is where JSX would be wrong, not
//              because it is currently doing work.

// limit of a text-shape heuristic, recorded rather than tuned away: narrowing the pattern until

//
// ⚠ THIS TABLE IS EMPTY, AND EMPTYING IT IS THE POINT RATHER THAN A TIDY-UP. Its one entry was
// 'No description.' on the Track ticket, exempted because "the action that would fill it (edit the
// description) needs the editor W2.3 has not built". W1.1.8 rebuilt that screen and the sentence is
// gone: the empty description now says what a description is FOR and offers a button that opens the
// editor and puts the caret in it. The reason had in fact been stale for longer than the sentence —
// the editor landed on IssueDetail with the ticket itself — and nothing could say so, because an
// exemption's REASON is prose while its KEY is checked. What retired it was the key going away.
//
// ⚠ AN EMPTY EXEMPTION TABLE IS NOT AN INERT ONE. The sweep below reads `EXEMPT`, which is still
// non-empty via (a), and the staleness check iterates whatever is in it; a future entry is caught
// by the same two rules. Left declared rather than deleted so the DISTINCTION between the two kinds
// of exemption survives — the comment above says why collapsing them hides which is which.
