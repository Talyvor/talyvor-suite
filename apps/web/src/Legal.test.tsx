//   · the pooling disclosure is present in the policy, because that is the claim most likely to

//   · the draft is marked as not reviewed, because a policy that omits that reads as complete and
//     is not;
//   · both cover Agent Wallets and the Marketplace, and neither claims an absence the code has
//     since filled (B28.16: self-service deletion and cash-out both exist).
