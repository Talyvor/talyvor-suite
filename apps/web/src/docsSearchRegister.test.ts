/**
 * THE DOCS SEARCH ROUTE MAKES SIX CLAIMS ABOUT talyvor-docs AND NOTHING ASKED talyvor-docs.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS HEADER SAID "`apps/bff/docs_search.go` MAKES FIVE CLAIMS" AND IS CORRECTED IN PLACE. The
 * count moved, and so did the SCOPE: the five request-side premises are all enforced in
 * `docs_search.go`, but the sixth is consumed in `apps/web/src/areas/docs/search.ts` — the
 * RESPONSE discriminator. A table that named only the BFF file could not hold it, and the count
 * rule at the bottom is keyed on this table, so leaving the sentence at five would have been a
 * stale number guarding a stale scope.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A DIFF ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The measurement that put these entries here is a NEGATIVE one, the same shape that put
 * `lib/api.ts`'s four Lens mirrors in the register: ALL FIVE REQUEST-SIDE CLAIMS RUN TRUE against
 * talyvor-docs `8189d7b53892f7f37e9756c5fe68e3cdd2c547da`, and the sixth runs true at docs main
 * `f5f9257a6521db686471865cddeed17e57b57082` (tab-3f8e, W1.7 — verified by executing the settle
 * command as the register PRINTS it, in a read-only `git archive` scratch export; talyvor-docs was
 * held by another tab and was NEVER written to). Nothing to fix in the claims; everything to fix
 * in the fact that nothing was watching them.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THE SIXTH IS NOT JUST A SIXTH — IT IS THE ONLY ONE A MONEY SENTENCE RESTS ON. The five
 * request-side premises decide what gets ASKED of Docs. `source` decides what the screen is allowed
 * to SAY the workspace was billed for. MEASURED by driving the shipped `SearchDocs` card at suite
 * `567e6d6a` with the dual-match literal renamed the way an upstream rename would deliver it:
 *
 *   source "both"    → semantic:"ran"     → "Embedding the query WAS a metered Lens call billed to
 *                                           this workspace under docs-search"
 *   source "hybrid"  → semantic:"unknown" → "WHERE LENS IS CONFIGURED, embedding the query is a
 *                                           metered call … Only a row from the semantic index
 *                                           proves it happened here"
 *
 * One renamed literal converts a definite charge into a conditional on a search that WAS billed —
 * and the hedge it falls back to explains itself with "Docs merges an unconfigured semantic search
 * in as an empty list", which is FALSE on that very response. The classifier reads only the two
 * positive literals, so a rename can never FABRICATE evidence; it silently DELETES it.
 *
 * ⚠ AND NO TEST IN THIS REPO CAN SEE THAT, BY CONSTRUCTION — which is why it is a register entry
 * and not a test. Censused at `567e6d6a`: the dual-match literal appears six times in apps/web —
 * three in `search.ts` (the union and the two classifier arms) and three in fixtures authored HERE
 * (`search.test.ts` ×2, `searchDocs.test.tsx` ×1). Both halves of every comparison live in this
 * repository, so the fixtures go on passing with the old literal while production receives the new.
 *
 * ⚠ CONTROLS ON THE SIXTH RULE, WHICH PASSED ON ITS FIRST RUN AND WAS THEREFORE DISTRUSTED: 6/6 as
 * predicted, 0 anomalies (`~/talyvor-queue/w17-sourceset-register-controls-3f8e.py`), catcher named
 * BEFORE each run, every mutation restored in a `finally` and sha256-verified back. N1 the
 * register's expectation renamed · N2 a FOURTH literal added to search.ts's union · N3 the entry's
 * marker re-aimed so `entryFor` finds nothing · N4 `declaredSources()` BLINDED to return [] · N5
 * the union replaced by a bare `string` — all RED, the last two the vacuity cases a rule comparing
 * two derived sets must not pass. N6 a reworded comment — GREEN.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE SETTLE COMMAND'S OWN QUOTES ARE EXPLICIT WHERE THE FIVE ABOVE USE A `.` WILDCARD, FOR A
 * MEASURED REASON. Written `Source: *.[a-z]*.` the pattern also matches the UNQUOTED `Source: src,`
 * line in the same function and yielded a phantom `src,` member — caught because the PRISTINE tree
 * was run as a control and failed, so the instrument was wrong rather than the product.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED BY EXECUTING docs' OWN `search.Handler.Search`, not read off the comments beside the
 * constants (a `git archive` scratch export in /tmp — talyvor-docs was held by another tab and was
 * NEVER written to). A recording full-text store, a recording `pgxDB`, and an httptest server
 * standing in for the Lens embeddings endpoint, so "which half ran" is an observation and not an
 * inference:
 *
 *     type=banana / ALL / Fulltext / full-text →  200 {"results":[],"total":0}, ft NOT called,
 *                                                 0 embeddings — NEITHER half ran
 *     type absent / type=all                   →  ft(limit 10, offset 0) AND 1 embedding
 *     type=fulltext&limit=5&offset=7           →  ft(5, 7)             — the offset reached SQL
 *     type=semantic&limit=5&offset=7           →  pgvector LIMIT 5 OFFSET 7
 *     type=all&limit=5&offset=7                →  ft(12, 0), pgvector LIMIT 12 OFFSET 0
 *     type=all&limit=10&offset=45              →  ft(50, 0)            — the 50-row merged window
 *     type=fulltext&limit=10&offset=90         →  ft(10, 90)           — single-source pages past it
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE NEGATIVES HAVE AN INSTRUMENT CONTROL, because "the sixth key was ignored" and "the
 * recorder cannot see any key" produce the same line. `type=semantic&space_id=sp-1` puts a non-nil
 * space into the pgvector query's $4; `space=sp-1` and `spaceId=sp-1` leave it nil. So the recorder
 * can tell a key that IS read from one that is not, which is what makes `sort`, `author` and
 * `highlight` landing on nothing a measurement rather than a blind spot.
 *
 * ── WHY A QUERY PARAMETER IS THE WORST CASE OF THIS WHOLE CLASS ──────────────
 *
 * A response shape that drifts renders a blank field. A request BODY key that drifts is a 200 with
 * a billed completion that read nothing (#234). A query PARAMETER that drifts is worse than both:
 * `r.URL.Query().Get` returns "" for a renamed key and Docs then DEFAULTS `type` to `all`, so a
 * renamed `type` upstream means `type=semantic` silently stops asking for the semantic half — and
 * the answer is a 200 of full-text rows BYTE-IDENTICAL to a correct one. Semantic search is one of
 * W1.7's eight AI features and its half embeds the query through Lens on every call, so this sits
 * on a metered path as well as a silent one.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GUARD CLAIMS, PRECISELY ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does NOT claim any of the five is true — nothing in this repository can check that. CI checks
 * out this repo alone, which is why these premises are in the register's UNCHECKABLE half at all.
 * It claims ONE link, the same one `mirrorSubsetRegister.test.ts` and `aiRequestBodyRegister.test.ts`
 * claim for responses and request bodies: the thing the deployer's command asks talyvor-docs about
 * is the thing this repository actually depends on. An entry naming a stale window, a stale key set
 * or a stale type set settles the wrong question and reports a pass for it.
 *
 * ⚠ THE POPULATIONS ARE DERIVED FROM `docs_search.go`, NOT TYPED INTO THE TABLE. The wire keys come
 * from the route's own `out.Set(…)` calls, the discriminator from `docsSearchTypes`, the window from
 * `docsSearchMergedWindow`, and the behavioural half from every `docsSearch*Refusal` constant the
 * file declares. Add a sixth parameter, a fourth type, or a third refusal resting on an upstream
 * behaviour and this goes red without anyone having to remember that it should.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, SAID OUT LOUD SO THE SCOPE IS NOT MISTAKEN FOR COVERAGE.
 *   · A value changed in BOTH this repo and the register in one change is not a red here — from
 *     inside this repository that is indistinguishable from a correct change. Only running the
 *     command in a talyvor-docs checkout tells them apart. That direction is the register's job.
 *   · The two REFUSAL entries are held to the constants existing and being used, not to their
 *     wording. A refusal whose prose drifts from what it refuses is not visible here.
 *   · CONTROL B1, run and recorded rather than reasoned about: the `type` entry pins the SHAPE of
 *     docs' two dispatch arms, so an upstream `else` branch that runs a half for an unrecognised
 *     type leaves both arms untouched and the command GREEN. Predicted green, measured green. It is
 *     a boundary of that command, and it is written here rather than discovered by someone
 *     trusting it.
 *
 * ⚠ THE FLOORS ARE NOT DECORATION. Every half of every rule is parsed out of source, so a rename or
 * a reformat yields no match — at which point a set equality over two empty sets passes having read
 * nothing. Each parse asserts it found something, and the register is asserted to hold EXACTLY as
 * many docs-search entries as this table has rows, in both directions.
 *
 * ⚠ CONTROLS ON THIS GUARD: 11 caught, 1 predicted-green, 0 anomalies
 * (`apps/web/scripts/w171-docs-search-register-controls.py`), each mutation alone, the FULL
 * apps/web suite every time so "nothing else catches it" is measured, verdict predicted BEFORE the
 * run, every file restored in a `finally` and sha256-verified back. A sixth parameter on the wire ·
 * a fourth type accepted · the window moved to 40 · a third refusal with no entry · a refusal no
 * longer written to a caller · the window entry deleted · the key-set expectation narrowed · the
 * type entry's pattern re-aimed (the entry still EXISTS and still COUNTS, so only the marker match
 * can catch it) · the window entry's expectation moved while the constant stays · **the wire-query
 * builder renamed so `out.Set` parses to nothing** · **the type map renamed** — all RED, the last
 * two the vacuity cases. A reworded comment — GREEN.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ FOUR OF THEM WERE BLINDED — the same defect with this file REMOVED — and the PROJECT WAS
 * GREEN for every one: a sixth wire parameter, a fourth type, a moved window, and a narrowed
 * register expectation are watched by nothing else in this repository. "Caught" here is this
 * guard's, not the suite's.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ AND ONE CONTROL FAILED FIRST, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH READING. G5 — the refusal still
 * declared but no longer WRITTEN to a caller — left this guard GREEN. Its usage rule counted
 * MENTIONS of the constant's name, and the doc comment above `docsSearchTypeRefusal` opens by
 * naming it, so the rule was satisfied for free by every documented constant and could not fail for
 * the defect it was written for. Comments and the declaration line are excluded now, and the
 * measurement is written beside `refusalUses` rather than the count quietly lowered.
 *
 * ⚠ CONTROLS ON THE FIVE COMMANDS THEMSELVES: 14 caught, 2 predicted-green, 0 anomalies
 * (`~/talyvor-queue/w171-docssearch-register-controls-4b7e.py`), verdict predicted BEFORE each run,
 * every mutation restored in a `finally` and sha256-verified back. Mutating the upstream export:
 * the window number moved · `maxFetchRows` renamed · `space_id` renamed · a SIXTH key read · the
 * offset key deleted · a FOURTH type accepted · `semantic` renamed · the empty default removed ·
 * either dispatch arm inverted to a negation · `sqlOffset` starting at 0 · the window ceasing to be
 * `offset+limit` · **the Search FUNCTION renamed** · **the handler file EMPTIED** — all RED, the
 * last two the vacuity cases a command that finds nothing must not pass. A reworded comment — GREEN.
