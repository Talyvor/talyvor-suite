// PanelReportsItsOwnQuery.test.tsx — A PANEL MUST REPORT THE STATE OF THE QUERY IT IS GUARDING.
//
// ── WHAT THIS CATCHES THAT SessionExpired.test.tsx CANNOT ────────────────────
//
// SessionExpired.test.tsx holds the "one dead session is one message" property, and it is a
// good guard. But its fixture — `mockAllApi(status)` — answers EVERY /api/* with the SAME
// status. Under a uniform fixture every panel's error object is interchangeable, so a panel
// that renders a DIFFERENT query's error produces byte-identical output to one that renders
// its own. The property that file exists to protect is therefore structurally invisible to it,
// not by an oversight in its assertions but by the shape of its input.
//
// Measured, on the tree before this file existed. Real <App />, real shipped queryClient, the
// mint ledger and the LXC ledger refused independently:
//
//     mint ledger / LXC ledger      /spend said                    / (Overview) said
//     ────────────────────────────  ─────────────────────────────  ─────────────────────────────
//     401 / 200                     "Couldn’t load the ledger."    "Unavailable."
//     500 / 401                     "Unavailable."                 "Couldn’t load the mint ledger."
//     401 / 401  (the shipped       "Unavailable."                 "Unavailable."
//                 fixture's shape)
//
// The third row is why nothing was red. The first two are the defect, in both directions:
// Spend.tsx guarded on `ledger.isError` and passed `lxc.error`, so it reported a query it was
// not rendering. Overview.tsx:326 is the SAME seam written correctly (`ledger.isError` →
// `ledger.error`), two files away, for the same request — which is what makes the middle
// column a positive control rather than an opinion.
//
// Both directions are harmful and neither is cosmetic:
//   · 401 on the ledger, LXC fine  → the bar says "your session has expired" and the panel
//     underneath adds a second, different diagnosis. That eighth voice is the entire reason
//     components/SessionExpiredBar.tsx exists.
//   · 500 on the ledger, LXC 401   → a genuine fault is laundered into the neutral
//     "Unavailable." placeholder, under a bar telling the reader to sign in again. Signing in
//     again does not fix a 500, and the fault has been made invisible.
//
// ── IT IS THE ORDINARY NAVIGATION, NOT A CONTRIVED ONE ───────────────────────
//
// Measured: clicking "Spend" from Overview issues exactly two requests —
// /api/usage?days=7 and /api/tokens/history — and does NOT re-request /api/lxc/history,
// because `["lxc-history",200,0]` is the SAME key on both screens and staleTime is 15s while
// Spend's mint-ledger key `["spend-ledger"]` is its own and always misses. So on that click the
// LXC query is a fresh cache hit with error === null at exactly the moment the mint ledger
// asks the network. "One query failing while its neighbour holds good data" is the default
// state of that navigation, not an edge case.
//
// ── THE PROPERTY, STATED SO A UNIFORM FIXTURE CANNOT SATISFY IT ──────────────
//
// A: refuse EXACTLY ONE route with 401 and answer every other route 200. The bar must appear
//    and NO panel anywhere may say "Couldn’t load"/"Couldn’t check". With one 401 in flight
//    there is no genuine fault to report, so any such sentence is a panel describing a request
//    that is not its own (or its own successful one).
// B: the inverse, scoped to one card, because a "somewhere on the page" assertion cannot tell
//    which panel spoke. A genuine fault must survive a 401 standing next to it.
//
// The baseline case is the must-stay-green companion: under an all-200 fixture every address
// must render with no failure wording at all. Without it, a fixture that stopped reaching the
// app would make A pass by rendering nothing.
