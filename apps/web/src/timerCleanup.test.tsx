/**
 * A TIMER THAT OUTLIVES ITS COMPONENT REDS THE BUILD AT RANDOM, AND ONE ALREADY DID.
 *
 * `Setup.tsx`'s copy button set `copyState` to 'copied' and scheduled `setCopyState('idle')` 1500ms
 * later. Nothing cancelled it. In a browser that is a state update on an unmounted tree; under
 * vitest it is worse, because the file's jsdom environment is torn down as soon as its tests
 * finish and the callback then touches a `window` that no longer exists:
 *
 *     ReferenceError: window is not defined
 *       (in a Timeout callback, from the copy handler in the Setup screen)
 *     This error was caught after test environment was torn down.
 *
 * ⚠ THE LINE COORDINATES ARE DELIBERATELY NOT QUOTED. The real trace named a file and a line;
 * this repo's own pointerAudit reds on a `file.tsx:NN` written into a comment, and it was right
 * to — the fix below moves that line, so the citation would have been stale in the same commit
 * that wrote it.
 *
 * ⚠ IT DOES NOT FAIL A TEST — IT FAILS THE RUN. Vitest reported `1741 passed` and exited non-zero
 * on "Unhandled Errors". Every assertion in the suite was green and CI was red, which is why no
 * test could have caught it and why a per-test guard is the wrong shape.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS A RACE, MEASURED AS ONE RATHER THAN ASSUMED: the SAME commit
 * (`b22e6f86cf34c7502e5018af09c18884935aa310`) ran red and then green on GitHub Actions with no
 * change in between. Whether the timer fires before or after its environment is torn down depends
 * on how long the worker process lives after the file finishes — which depends on the runner's
 * core count. It never reproduced locally across a full run, a sequential run, and a run pinned to
 * two workers. **A flake whose window is set by the machine is not a flake you can wait out.**
 *
 * ⚠ THE POPULATION IS TWO AND THE OTHER ONE IS ALREADY RIGHT, which is what makes this a defect
 * rather than a design question: `BillingReturn.tsx` schedules its timeout inside `useEffect` and
 * returns `() => clearTimeout(t)`. The correct shape was already in the codebase, one directory
 * away, when the wrong one was written.
