/**
 * THE EYEBROW AUDIT — the token carries the size and the tracking; the CALL SITE carries the case,
 * and until now nobody checked that it did.
 *
 * preset.ts §THE EYEBROW states the rule and hands enforcement to nobody:
 *
 *     ⚠ THE UPPERCASE IS NOT IN HERE, deliberately. `text-transform: uppercase` maps
 *     µ (U+00B5) to Greek capital Mu, and µLENS/µLXC sit inside these labels. It is applied
 *     at the call site, where MuNumeral can keep its µ in a `normal-case` span.
 *
 * caseAudit.ts took the DANGEROUS half of that sentence — a transform must not REPLACE a character
 * — and left the other half open, because the two rules read in opposite directions: caseAudit asks
 * "is this uppercase hurting a character", this asks "is the uppercase there at all".
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A RULE AND NOT A PREFERENCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * preset.ts's own argument for putting the tracking IN the token applies unchanged to the case:
 * "a caller who applies the size and forgets the tracking gets small mono text, not an eyebrow."
 * An eyebrow that forgets the uppercase is 11px mono at 0.24em — letter-spacing wide enough to be
 * legible only as a label, carrying text that is not in label case. It does not read as a smaller
 * heading; it reads as broken spacing.
 *
 * ── MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS WRITTEN, AND THE NUMBER IS THE REASON THIS EXISTS ─────────────────
 *
 * At `ff17b41`, dropping `uppercase` from ONE rendered eyebrow — Overview.tsx:206, on the console's
 * densest eyebrow surface — left 56 test files and 678 tests GREEN. Not one assertion in either
 * package could see it. That is the same shape as the µ half: `text-transform` is a PAINT-TIME
 * transform, so `textContent` is identical with and without it and every text assertion passes over
 * it. A rendered-text audit could not have found this and never will.
 *
 * ── WHY THE DOM AND NOT THE SOURCE, MEASURED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two reasons, both observed rather than argued:
 *
 *  1. THE CLASS LIST IS ASSEMBLED AT RUNTIME AT REAL SITES. Members.tsx builds it with `cn` and a
 *     conditional (`m.role === 'owner' ? 'font-semibold text-ink' : 'text-muted'`) and Pill.tsx does
 *     the same. A source rule reads the literal; only the DOM sees what was assembled.
 *  2. `text-transform` INHERITS, so the answer depends on the nearest ANCESTOR that declares one.
 *     An eyebrow is allowed to take its uppercase from a parent. Source cannot answer that.
 *
 * Measured over the whole web suite at `ff17b41`: 21 source call sites in the two packages collapse
 * to 14 distinct rendered (tag, class list) pairs, and all 14 have `uppercase` in effect.
 *
 * ── WHY IT CANNOT DISAGREE WITH caseAudit, VERIFIED RATHER THAN INHERITED ────────────────────
 *
 * The obvious fear is that this rule demands an uppercase that caseAudit forbids. It cannot, and
 * the reason is structural: this judges the element whose OWN class list names `text-eyebrow`;
 * MuNumeral's protection is a `normal-case` span rendered by CaseSafe as a CHILD of that element
 * (MuNumeral.tsx:31 opens the eyebrow, line 33 puts CaseSafe inside it). Different elements, so
 * both rules are satisfiable at once — and the shipped product satisfies both today.
 *
 * ⚠ It shares `transformInEffect` with caseAudit ON PURPOSE. "The transform in effect" must mean
 * exactly one thing across the two rules, or a µ could be protected under one definition and
 * uppercased under the other. That function is positive-controlled in caseAudit.test.tsx.
 *
 * ── THE LIMIT, STATED RATHER THAN IMPLIED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This sees what a test RENDERS. `check-audit-reach.mjs` makes that stronger than it sounds — it
 * fails CI when an exported component is never rendered by any test — but reach is enforced per
 * COMPONENT, not per BRANCH. A `cond ? 'text-eyebrow' : …` arm that no fixture takes is rendered by
 * nobody and invisible here. Measured, so the size of that gap is known rather than guessed: two of
 * the 14 rendered sites appear only TWICE in the entire suite (pm.tsx's fence label and Members'
 * owner row), so they hang on a single fixture each. eyebrowAudit.test.tsx closes that from the
 * other side with a SOURCE rule over both packages, which reads the literal and needs no fixture.
 *
 * ── THE CONTROLS, AND THE TWO THEY CORRECTED ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 13/14 CAUGHT — scripts/w11-eyebrow-controls.py. Every control asserts its anchor count BEFORE
 * writing, verifies the bytes changed ON DISK, and names a must-red target AND a must-stay-green
 * companion, so a control that reds both is reported SUSPECT rather than counted.
 *
 * ⚠ THE DIVISION OF LABOUR BETWEEN THE TWO RULES IS MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED. Three controls exist
 * only to show that neither rule subsumes the other:
 *   · C2  an eyebrow in a branch no fixture takes  → source RED, Members surface GREEN
 *   · C14 an eyebrow whose token is assembled (`'text-' + 'eyebrow'`), so no literal carries it
 *                                                  → Members surface RED, source GREEN
 *   · C3  an eyebrow that genuinely INHERITS its uppercase from a wrapper
 *                                                  → source RED (it is strict), surface GREEN
 * C3 is the one that earns the sentence above about inheritance: the DOM rule stays green on a
 * real product change where the transform arrives from an ancestor. Asserting that on a fixture
 * only proves the fixture.
 *
 * ⚠ C3 FIRST RAN AS A BROKEN BUILD AND WOULD HAVE SCORED AS A CATCH. The first version added an
 * opening `<span>` without its closing tag; esbuild failed, both targets went red, and the harness
 * reported SUSPECT rather than CAUGHT — which is the only reason it was not written down as
 * evidence. It is now built from the file's own bytes and asserts the tags balance.
 *
 * ⚠ C13 IS NOT CAUGHT, AND IT IS SHIPPED THAT WAY DELIBERATELY. Disabling the offender REPORT in
 * test-setup.ts (the audit still runs; nobody reads it) reds nothing, because the report is silent
 * while the product is clean. C14 is what makes that statement precise rather than a shrug: the
 * report is the ONLY catcher for an eyebrow whose class list is assembled at runtime, so what C13
 * costs is exactly that class of defect and nothing else. Every one of the other six audits has
 * the same unguarded reporting path; this is a property of the shared wiring, not of this rule.
