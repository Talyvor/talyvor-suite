/**
 * MOTION ON STATE CHANGE — the last line of the site's language the console had not ported,
 * and the one with a trap in it.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED OFF THE SERVED SITE, 2026-08-09, eleven pages fetched from
 * talyvor.higgsfield.app (home, economy, pricing, lens, track, docs, code, self-host,
 * attribution, roadmap, terms):
 *
 *     transition-colors        174   duration-200   151   ← the modal duration, by a mile
 *     transition-transform      52   duration-300    69
 *     transition-all            22   duration-500    32
 *     transition-none           72   duration-700     9
 *     active:scale-[0.98]        3   motion-reduce:transition-none  72
 *
 * And measured on this repo at 9e03e50: `active:scale` appeared ZERO times — no press
 * feedback anywhere — and NOT ONE of the nine `transition-*` class lists carried a
 * `duration-*`, so every one of them ran at Tailwind's default. That default is not the
 * site's number; asked directly, the generator emits `transition-duration: 150ms` for a
 * bare `transition-colors`. Fifty milliseconds fast on every control in the product.
 *
 * ⚠ THE TRAP, AND THE REASON THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN A LINE IN A COMMIT MESSAGE.
 * theme.css's reduced-motion block forces `transition-duration: .001ms !important` and
 * stops there. A transition-duration of zero does not remove a transform — it removes the
 * TWEEN. `active:scale-98` under that block is not "no motion", it is the same 2% shrink
 * arriving INSTANTLY, delivered to exactly the people who asked for less of it. The block
 * has to neutralise the scale itself.
 *
 * ⚠ CORRECTED BY `w11-state-transitions`, BECAUSE THE SENTENCE ABOVE OVERSTATES ITS CONTRAST.
 * "Delivered to exactly the people who asked for less of it" only bites if everyone ELSE gets a
 * tween. MEASURED from the built sheet at `9a18533`: `.transition-colors` resolves to
 * `color,background-color,border-color,text-decoration-color,fill,stroke` — NO `transform` — and
 * all three press sites ride `transition-colors`. THE PRESS IS INSTANT FOR EVERYONE AND ALWAYS
 * HAS BEEN. The neutralisation below is still correct and still needed: it removes the SHRINK,
 * not its tween, and that is a real difference for a reduced-motion reader. What is wrong is the
 * implied comparison. Whether the press SHOULD tween is a feel decision, so this merge corrects
 * the claim and changes no timing — see NOT_TWEENED.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE TRAP INSIDE THE TRAP, which is why the fourth guard below exists. The obvious
 * neutralisation — `transform: none !important` on the universal selector — is wrong, and
 * wrong in a way nothing else in this repo would catch. The Switch's ON state is
 * `data-[state=checked]:translate-x-3.5` on its thumb: a TRANSFORM carrying STATE, not
 * decoration. Kill transform wholesale and the thumb sits at the off position while
 * `aria-checked="true"`, leaving the accent track as the only signal — a hue, alone,
 * for the one user group most likely to also need a non-colour one. So the neutralisation
 * is scoped to the two scale variables, and this file pins that it stays scoped.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT SEE. It reads the SHIPPED stylesheet — theme.css plus
 * what Tailwind generates from the real config and the real content — and reasons about
 * one two-rule cascade in it (below). It does not run a browser, so it cannot watch a
 * button shrink. Everything it claims is a claim about declarations, and it says so.
