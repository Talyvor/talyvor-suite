/**
 * TWO FILES SAID THEY MIRRORED AN UPSTREAM STRUCT **VERBATIM** AND BOTH WERE MISSING FIELDS THAT
 * ARE ON EVERY RESPONSE.
 *
 * ── THE FINDING THIS EXISTS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * MEASURED, not read: `areas/track/types.ts` headed itself "JSON-verbatim from talyvor-track @
 * a3bc7b2 … Field names and optionality mirror the Go structs' json tags exactly — so the day the
 * BFF proxies these routes, the fixture types are already the live types." At talyvor-track
 * `6bf443a` its `TrackIssue` was missing NINE of `model.Issue`'s thirty json fields:
 *
 *     labels          sort_order            ← NO omitempty: on EVERY issue response
 *     milestone_id?   field_values?   is_blocked?   relations?
 *     time_tracked_sec?   rice_score?   ice_score?
 *
 * `areas/docs/api.ts` headed itself "Shapes mirror talyvor-docs internal/model/model.go VERBATIM
 * (field-for-field, at e0cf605), so wiring the tree and reader is adding a fetch — the types
 * already speak the upstream shape." At talyvor-docs `d89a005` its `DocsPage` was missing
 * `own_ai_cost_usd` and `total_ai_cost_usd` — both without omitempty, so both on every page
 * response, and one of them is the column suite #204 registered a whole premise about.
 *
 * ⚠ NEITHER IS A LIVE BUG. The BFF streams these bodies verbatim, so the extra keys arrive and are
 * simply invisible to TypeScript. What is false is the SENTENCE, and specifically its second half:
 * "the types ARE ALREADY the live types" is a present-tense operational promise, and the next
 * person to wire a screen reads it instead of the upstream. That is the same decay
 * `upstreamCitations.test.ts` was written about, wearing a different form — a sha and the word
 * VERBATIM rather than a line number — which is exactly why that guard could not see it.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE HANDOVER'S CENSUS WAS SHORT, WHICH IS WHY THIS FILE HOLDS A TABLE AND NOT TWO CASES.
 * The two files above were handed on. A sweep for cross-repo shape claims found FIVE, and
 * measuring all of them changed the answer twice:
 *
 *   · `areas/lens/Members.tsx#RosterMember` and `lib/api.ts#LXCSnapshot` MATCH their upstreams
 *     today — and neither names the commit it was true at, which is weaker than a stale sha, not
 *     stronger. They are in the table.
 *   · `lib/api.ts#LensBalance.held_balance_ulens` is `?:` against a Go field with NO omitempty —
 *     a divergence my extractor flagged and the file itself EXPLAINS twenty lines below the
 *     header: "Optional because a Lens older than the change that added it omits the field; `?? 0`
 *     at the read sites is a deployment-skew tolerance, not a default." A deliberate, documented,
 *     load-bearing divergence, and NOT a defect.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS FILE HANDLED THAT ONE BY LEAVING IT OUT OF THE TABLE AND SAYING
 * SO IN THIS PARAGRAPH — a hand exclusion, recorded as prose, inside the guard written to stop
 * trusting prose. It is `UPSTREAM-SPELLING` now: declared in the file that makes the divergence,
 * so the register still asks Lens about the shape Lens actually has, and a SECOND field quietly
 * acquiring a `?` reds instead of joining an unwritten exception. The rest of `lib/api.ts` was
 * measured at lens `a04310a` while doing it — `LXCSnapshot`, `LedgerEntry` and `LXCLedgerEntry`
 * match their Go structs field for field, which is a negative result and is why nothing in those
 * three changed.
 *
 * ── WHY THE FIX IS A DECLARED SUBSET AND NOT NINE MORE FIELDS ────────────────
 *
 * Adding the nine to `TrackIssue` makes the sentence true this afternoon and re-arms the identical
 * trap on the next upstream field, with still nothing watching — the shape
 * `upstreamCitations.test.ts` rejected when it refused to "fix" seven wrong line numbers by
 * correcting them. Worse, four of the nine (`field_values`, `relations`, …) have shapes this
 * repository would have to guess at, and a guessed type is a claim about another repo written in
 * the one place TypeScript will enforce it.
 *
 * So each mirror DECLARES its omissions by name, in its own file, and the claim becomes checkable
 * in two halves that meet in the middle:
 *
 *   the interface's own fields  ∪  its declared UPSTREAM-ONLY names
 *      =  the field list the deploy register tells a deployer to check upstream
 *
 * The left half is parsed out of TypeScript, the right half out of `deploy/decision-expiry.sh`.
 * Neither is a third copy of anything: the register's command reads the Go struct's json tags out
 * of the upstream file and compares them to that union, so `git grep`-able truth on both sides.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GUARD CLAIMS, PRECISELY ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does NOT claim any interface here matches its upstream. Nothing in this repository's CI can:
 * CI checks out this repository alone, and a guard that reads a sibling repo WHEN PRESENT is inert
 * in CI, which is the one place it would have to fire — `topUpMirrorRegister.test.ts` measured
 * exactly that and moved its premise to the register for it. This claims one link: the field list
 * the deployer's command asks talyvor-track / talyvor-docs about is the field list this repo
 * believes in. An entry naming a stale set settles the wrong question and reports a pass for it.
 *
 * It also claims the two halves cannot contradict each other silently: a name cannot be declared
 * UPSTREAM-ONLY while the interface mirrors it, and a file that declares omissions cannot go on
 * telling its reader it mirrors upstream VERBATIM.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, said out loud so the scope is not mistaken for coverage. A field DELETED
 * from a TS interface and added to its UPSTREAM-ONLY list in the same change is not a red — the
 * union is unchanged, and from here that is indistinguishable from a deliberate narrowing. Only
 * running the register's command upstream tells those apart. That direction is the register's job
 * and it is why these entries exist at all.
 *
 * ⚠ THE FLOORS ARE NOT DECORATION. Both sides are parsed out of source, so a rename, a reformat or
 * a deleted entry yields no match — at which point a set equality over two empty sets passes
 * having read nothing. Every parse asserts it found EXACTLY ONE subject, so the ways this guard
 * can stop seeing are reds rather than silences.

 *   · FALSE NEGATIVE. The same paragraph asserted three interfaces "match their Go structs field
 *     for field" — an identity claim in the file's own voice — and the rule did NOT see it,
 *     because the list held the HYPHENATED spelling only. That one would have shipped.
 *
 * The two costs are not symmetric: a false positive is a rewrite, a false negative is the finding
 * this whole file exists for, arriving back through a spelling. So the spaced form is matched too
