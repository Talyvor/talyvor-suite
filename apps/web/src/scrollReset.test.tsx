/**
 * scrollReset.test.tsx — CLIENT-SIDE NAVIGATION CARRIED THE PREVIOUS PAGE'S SCROLL OFFSET INTO
 * THE NEXT PAGE, so a reader who scrolled down and then clicked a destination arrived part-way
 * through it. The browser resets scroll on a real navigation; this application replaced real
 * navigations with client-side ones and did not replace the thing they did for free.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MEASURED, IN REAL CHROME ON THE BUILT ARTIFACT ──────────────────────────
 *
 * `apps/web/dist` at `088d711` served over HTTP with a BFF stub, driven in Chrome at 1280x720.
 * The SAME PAIR OF PAGES and the SAME STARTING OFFSET, twice — the only difference between the
 * rows is whether the navigation was a full page load or a click on the in-page link:
 *
 *     /terms scrolled to y=900  --(browser: location change, full load)-->  /privacy   y = 0
 *     /terms scrolled to y=900  --(click the "Privacy" link, client-side)-->  /privacy y = 900
 *
 * The full-load row is the POSITIVE CONTROL: it proves the instrument reads 0 when a reset
 * happens, and that /privacy does not scroll itself. 900 is not a clamp — /privacy's maximum
 * offset is 1881, so the offset was CARRIED, not coincidentally landed on.
 *
 * Inside the console, from the tallest gated address:
 *
 *     /setup scrolled to its bottom (y=1905.5) --click--> /settings   y = 116.5  (its MAXIMUM)
 *     /setup scrolled to its bottom (y=1905.5) --click--> /privacy    y = 1881   (its MAXIMUM)
 *
 * so clicking "Privacy" from a scrolled page opened the privacy policy at its last line.
 *
 * ── WHY THE OBVIOUS FIX IS WRONG, ALSO MEASURED ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `history.scrollRestoration` is `auto` and the browser's own restoration WORKS across these
 * client-side entries — measured in the same session: /terms at y=900, forward to /privacy,
 * scrolled to y=300, `history.back()` restored 900, `history.forward()` restored 300. A
 * scroll-to-top on every location change would DESTROY that: the back button would drop the
 * reader at the top of a page they had read half of. So the reset is applied on PUSH and
 * REPLACE and NOT on POP — the browser keeps the half of this it already does correctly.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE CAN AND CANNOT SEE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ jsdom HAS NO LAYOUT AND NO SCROLLING. `window.scrollY` is 0 forever here regardless of what
 * the product does, so a position assertion in this file could never fail — the first describe
 * block MEASURES that and pins it, so nobody later writes one believing it guards something.
 * What is assertable here is the MECHANISM: that the top of the document is requested on a push
 * and is not requested on a pop, at every address and on both sides of the auth gate. The Chrome
 * rows above are the proof that the mechanism is the one the reader needs.
