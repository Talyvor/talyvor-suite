/**
 * LandmarkCoverage.test.tsx — EVERY SCREEN A PERSON SEES BEFORE THEY HAVE A SESSION PUT ITS WHOLE
 * BODY IN NO LANDMARK REGION, AND THE ONE THEY SEE MOST HAD NO LANDMARK AT ALL.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MEASURED, IN THE DOM, AS A PROPORTION ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A throwaway probe drove the real `<App />` to every address and walked its text nodes, asking of
 * each: is any ancestor a landmark region (main/banner/navigation/contentinfo/complementary/form/
 * search, by element or by role)? `<script>`, `<style>` and `<template>` text excluded, because a
 * keyframes block is not something a reader navigates to.
 *
 *     the twelve gated addresses, signed in     0% of characters outside a landmark
 *     /marketing                                0%
 *     /signin                                  93%   (4 of 5 interactive controls, too)
 *     /signup                                  97%   (4 of 5)
 *     /privacy                                 98%   (6,447 of 6,584 characters)
 *     /terms                                   98%   (6,252 of 6,377)
 *     the refused-session card, at EVERY       100%  (215 of 215) — and ZERO landmark elements
 *       gated address                                of ANY kind on the page
 *
 * The console is not the product's weak half here; it is the reference. `Shell` gives every gated
 * address `aside`, `nav`, `header` and `main`, and 100% of the text lands inside one. The marketing
 * page has `header`/`main`/`footer`. The five surfaces that DID NOT are exactly the ones a person
 * meets BEFORE they are signed in — the two front doors, the two policy documents a person reads to
 * decide whether to sign up at all, and the card that replaces every gated page when the session is
 * refused.
 *
 * ⚠ THE LAST ROW IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS AND IT IS NOT AN ADDRESS. `AuthGate`'s signed-out card is
 * a STATE, not a route: it is what `/`, `/ledger`, `/keys` — every gated address — renders when
 * /auth/me says the session is refused. Address-shaped sweeps cannot see it, which is why this file
 * asserts it as a state and why it went unmeasured while twelve addresses were being swept.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A DEFECT AND NOT A PREFERENCE ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Landmark navigation is one of the two ways a screen-reader user moves through a page (the other
 * is headings, which `a19c18f`/#126 and `90a942a`/#127 dealt with). On these five surfaces the
 * region list is empty or holds one region containing 2% of the words, so "jump to the main
 * content" has nothing to jump to and the body is reachable only by reading from the top.
 *
 * The rule being applied is the product's own, already shipped twice: `Shell` and `Landing` both
 * put their content in `<main>`. Thirteen surfaces do it; five did not. This is not a session
 * choosing a convention.
 *
 * ── THE FIX PROMOTES ELEMENTS THAT WERE ALREADY THERE, AND IT IS ZERO-PIXEL ──────────
 *
 * No element is added and no class moves. Four `<div>`s that already wrapped exactly the content
 * in question become `<main>`:
 *
 *     Entry.tsx      the EntryFrame body under the header   (/signin, /signup)
 *     AuthGate.tsx   the SignedOut card's centring wrapper  (the refused-session card)
 *     Privacy.tsx    the page container
 *     Terms.tsx      the page container
 *
 * Measured out of the BUILT stylesheet rather than assumed: it contains NO rule whose selector
 * names `main`, `header`, `footer`, `section`, `article` or `aside` — every box on these screens is
 * drawn by utility classes, and those are unchanged. A `<main>` carrying the same classes paints
 * the same pixels as the `<div>` did.
 *
 * ⚠ ONE CONSEQUENCE, STATED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: on `/privacy` and `/terms` the container that
 * becomes `<main>` CONTAINS `LegalHeader`'s `<header>`, and a `<header>` inside `main` is no longer
 * a `banner`. So those two pages trade one region holding 2% of the page for one holding 100% of
 * it. That block is a document title — the page name, the date, the way back — not site chrome;
 * `Landing`'s sticky top bar is what a banner is for, and it keeps its own.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ THE INSTRUMENT IS CONTROLLED IN THE TEST, IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, BEFORE IT IS POINTED AT THE
 * PRODUCT. A counter that reports zero is indistinguishable from a page with nothing to report —
 * this queue's oldest trap, and this instrument's first version fell into the mirror image of it:
 * it counted a `<style>` element's keyframes as uncovered text and reported `/marketing`, which is
 * correctly structured, at 9%. So `outsideLandmark` is run against a synthetic DOM first: text
 * outside a region must be counted, the same text inside one must not, and `<style>` text must be
 * ignored wherever it sits.
 *
 * ⚠ AND EVERY CASE CARRIES A FLOOR. "0 characters outside a landmark" is also what a page that
 * rendered NOTHING reports. Each address asserts it drew a plausible amount of text first, so a
 * blank screen fails instead of passing perfectly.
 *
 * ⚠ THE PUBLIC ROUTE SET IS DERIVED FROM `App.tsx`, NOT LISTED HERE FROM MEMORY. Every literal
 * `<Route path="…">` in that file — the only place a public page can be declared — must appear
 * below, so a sixth public surface cannot be added without this sweep noticing.
