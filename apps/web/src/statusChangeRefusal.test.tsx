// statusChangeRefusal.test.tsx — THE WRITE THAT FAILED AND SAID NOTHING.
//
// Track's issue list carries a status `<select>` on every row. It is the fastest write in the
// product — one gesture, no form, no confirm — and it was the only write with NO error surface
// at all: `setStatus.isError` was read nowhere in the file. `setStatus` appeared exactly three
// times (the useMutation, `disabled={setStatus.isPending}`, and `.mutate(…)`), so a refusal had
// nowhere to land.
//
// MEASURED before this file existed, real `<App/>`, real shipped queryClient, a STATEFUL fake so
// an accepted write actually moves the stored row — reads served 200 and the write refused, which
// is the live condition (the BFF session outlives the workspace token by four hours: tenant.go
// 8h token, 12h session, and the reads on screen were fetched before it died):
//
//     write refused with   PATCH sent   select after   pill after   characters added to the page
//     ------------------   ----------   ------------   ----------   ---------------------------
//     401 dead credential  yes          in_progress    In progress   0
//     500 genuine fault    yes          in_progress    In progress   0
//     403 refused origin   yes          in_progress    In progress   0
//     200 accepted         yes          done           Done          (the row moved)
//
// ⚠ ZERO CHARACTERS, ON EVERY STATUS CODE. The reader picked "done", the control bounced back to
// the value Track still holds, and the product said nothing. The only signal a refusal happened
// is that the control they just set reverted — which reads as a UI glitch, not a refusal.
//
// ⚠ AND NO BAR CAN COVER FOR IT. SessionExpiredBar derives from the QUERY cache, the reads here
// are cached and good, and the shipped client sets `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` — so nothing
// refetches, no query error exists, and the bar is absent. Measured false in all three refusals.
//
// ⚠ IT IS NOT A SESSION FINDING. 500 and 403 are silent too, so this is strictly larger than the
// dead-credential family: it is a write that fails silently on every refusal.
//
// ⚠ THE SIBLING TWENTY LINES ABOVE HAS THE SENTENCE. `create.isError` renders a fully reasoned
// three-state message in this same file (#140 rewrote it an hour before this was measured), from
// the same `useMutation` API. Nobody carried it across to the mutation next to it.
//
// WHY THE FIXTURE IS STATEFUL: with a fake that serves the same row back, an accepted write and a
// refused one look identical on screen, and a positive control that cannot tell them apart proves
// nothing. Here 200 moves the row to "Done" and the refusals leave it at "In progress" — that
// difference is what makes the must-stay-greens below say anything.
