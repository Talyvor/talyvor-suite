 * EVERY FIGURE THIS SUITE RENDERS IS AUDITED, on every surface, in every test.

 * in one test file on purpose: the money surfaces already have tests with real fetch mocks, so
 * riding them audits the product as it is actually rendered instead of re-mocking it beside a
 * second copy of the fixtures. A surface with no test is audited by nothing — which is exactly
 * what MUST_RENDER_CURRENCY exists to say out loud rather than leave implied.

/**
 * AND EVERY CASING TRANSFORM IS AUDITED FOR WHAT IT REPLACES, on the same ride.
 *
 * `text-transform: uppercase` maps µ (U+00B5) to Greek capital Mu, so an uppercase eyebrow renders
 * µLXC as MLXC — a different SI prefix, twelve orders of magnitude out, on the page whose figures
 * exist to be checked against the ledger. preset.ts states the rule and cannot enforce it; the
 * class and the character meet in the DOM and nowhere else. caseAudit.ts carries the measurement,
 * the predicate and the one hole it leaves.

/**
 * AND EVERY CONTROL IS AUDITED FOR THE HUE IT WEARS ON KEYBOARD FOCUS, on the same ride.
 *
 * focus.ts declares a 2px accent outline and says it is "applied to every interactive element";
 * only a component that imports it has one, and a hand-rolled control gets the BROWSER'S default
 * ring instead — measured in Chrome 151 as rgb(153,200,255) dark / rgb(0,95,204) light, against
 * the `accent` token in either theme. A string constant cannot check its own reach, and `asChild`
 * merges the ring onto an element the source never names, so the DOM is the only place to ask.

/**
 * AND EVERY CHARACTER IS ASKED OF THE FACE THAT HAS TO DRAW IT, on the same ride.

 * that each url() resolves to something whose first four bytes are `wOF2`. glyphAudit.ts reads the
 * cmaps out of the shipped binaries and asks whether the product's own copy is inside them.

/**
 * AND EVERY PLACEHOLDER IS ASKED WHICH COLOUR PAINTS IT, on the same ride.

 * nothing and Chrome paints rgb(117,117,117) — measured, the SAME grey in both themes, not derived
 * from currentColor — which scores 4.25:1 light and 4.30:1 dark on `bg-canvas`, below the 4.5:1
 * AA body floor `contrast.test.ts` holds every text token to. That guard scores TOKEN PAIRS and
 * cannot ask whether some text on screen wears no token at all. placeholderAudit.ts carries the
 * engine measurement and why the class must be the element's own.

 * plane at ten sites and NOTHING asks whether a role other than `ink` lands there: measured,
 * `faint` on it is 3.97:1 light / 3.63:1 dark, under the 4.5:1 AA body floor the same file holds
 * every other pair to, and `NavItem` declared exactly that pair on its icon. A curated matrix
 * cannot ask what the product actually renders; planes.ts carries the numbers and planeAudit.ts
 * the ancestor walk that finds the plane.

 * transform HURTS a character; nothing asked whether it is there at all. Measured at `ff17b41`:
 * dropping `uppercase` from one rendered eyebrow left all 678 tests green, because
 * `text-transform` is paint-time and `textContent` is identical either way.

 * construction. Measured at `732cf32` with a throwaway probe over the whole suite: of 87 field
 * records, the only one on screen holding a figure off the face is Convert's LXC amount — the
