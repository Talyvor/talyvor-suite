/**
 * B27.12 — with Lens answering `{}` for every read, no screen throws and each says its read failed.
 *
 * Measured before the change, driving these same addresses: `/`, `/keys`, `/agents`, `/spend`,
 * `/members`, `/features`, `/track` and `/docs` threw while drawing ("rows.filter is not a
 * function", "keys.map is not a function", …) and React unmounted the whole app, sidebar and all;
 * `/earnings`, `/chat`, `/plans` and `/operator` read the empty object as "switched off", "empty" or
 * "not on sale"; `/billing` printed NaN.
