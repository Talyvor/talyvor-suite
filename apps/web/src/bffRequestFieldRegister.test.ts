/**
 * EVERY FIELD THIS APP PUTS IN A REQUEST TO ITS OWN BFF IS ONE THE BFF DECODES — and every field
 * the BFF decodes is one something here sends, or is named in a table with a reason.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS DIRECTION HAD NO GUARD ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `lib/calledRoutes.test.ts` pins that every BFF ADDRESS this app names is one the BFF mounts.
 * `lensRequestBodyRegister.test.ts` pins what the BFF sends UPSTREAM. Between them the ADDRESS is
 * checked and the NEXT HOP's body is checked, and the fields in the request the browser actually
 * makes are checked by neither.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE FAILURE HERE IS SILENT, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT NEEDS A GUARD MOST. talyvor-track
 * proved the loud half by execution (W3.68, merge `8359a30`): its `httpx.DecodeJSON` calls
 * `DisallowUnknownFields`, so an undeclared field is a 400 — and two shipped write paths were dead
 * that way with four censuses green over them. Measured in this repository before writing this
 * file: `DisallowUnknownFields` occurs ONCE in `apps/bff` and it is inside a COMMENT. Nothing here
 * refuses an unknown field, so the same defect answers **200 having changed nothing**. A 400
 * eventually reaches a bug report; a control that silently does nothing does not.
 *
 * ── THE RESULT, MEASURED AT 0b8a55e ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *  · 29 `fetch` sites, 11 with a body. Eight are bounded by the type checker and EVERY field each
 *    one sends is decoded by the handler that serves it.
 *  · Three bodies the checker cannot bound, all three deliberate pass-throughs and all three named
 *    in `unboundedBodies` below WITH WHAT CONSUMES THEM — the BFF decodes no field of any of them.
 *  · ONE decoded field with no sender: `expires_at` on `POST /api/keys`. Every layer beneath the
 *    console implements key expiry and the console cannot set one. It is pinned in
 *    `NO_SENDER_IN_THIS_REPO`, not fixed: whether to offer the control is a product and
 *    security-posture decision.
 *
 * ── FLOORS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both halves report an ABSENCE, and a scanner that has gone blind reports the empty set, which
 * agrees with everything. The floors below are UNDER the measured counts, not AT them.
