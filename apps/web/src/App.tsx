/**
 * THE CONSOLE'S PAGES — ONE TABLE, because two tables that must agree do not.

 * ⚠ WHAT THIS REPLACED, MEASURED AT `c9e1e8a` WITH EVERY GATE GREEN. The route list and a
 * separate `titleFor()` each held their own copy of the paths, and they disagreed on every
 * address that has no page:
 *   · `titleFor` ended `exact[pathname] ?? 'Overview'`, so /admin — the retired operator
 *     console someone still has bookmarked — rendered the header "Overview" above the body
 *     "Nothing at this address". The sidebar highlighted nothing, so the ONLY name on the
 *     screen was the wrong one.
 *   · the three prefix rules over-matched by a character: /billingx titled "Billing",
 *     /trackers "Track", /docs-old "Docs", each of them routed to the catch-all.
 * Eight addresses measured, eight titled as a page they were not. ConsoleTitle.test.tsx drives
 * the real `<App />` to each one and reads the banner, so the assertion survives this table
 * being replaced again.
 *
 * The title now travels WITH the route, so a new page cannot be added without naming itself,
 * and `matchRoutes` answers "which page is this" with the same matcher `<Routes>` uses —
 * `startsWith` was never that matcher, which is the whole defect above.

      {/* ── THE POLICIES, AND WHY HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
          Both routes have always resolved, and until now nothing inside the app linked to
          them: they appeared on the marketing page, the sign-in card and the consent screen —
          three surfaces a signed-in person has already passed and does not return to. So the
          moment someone wanted to check what we do with their data, the answer was "type the
          URL", which is unreachable for anyone who does not already know it.

          NOT A PAGE FOOTER. A footer sits below the content, and this app's content-heavy
          routes (Ledger, Spend) scroll — so on exactly the pages where a person is looking at
          their data and thinks to ask, the footer is permanently below the fold. The sidebar
          is `sticky top-0`, which makes this reachable from any route without scrolling. It
          also avoids adding a region to the shared Shell in packages/ui for two links.

          NOT THE SETTINGS PAGE. Settings is where you look for YOUR settings; a person hunting
          for OUR policies has no reason to expect them there, and it costs a click and a guess.
          Fine as a second home, wrong as the only one.

          NOT A NAV ITEM. Rendered as small muted text rather than NavItem, below the product
          groups and after a rule: these are not destinations you visit in the course of work,
          and styling them like Overview or Keys would overstate them. Findable without being
          prominent is the whole requirement for a legal surface.

          Link, not <a href>: same-tab client-side navigation, and it keeps a real href so the
          link is a link to assistive tech and to a middle-click. */}

 * ⚠ THE ONE THING A REAL NAVIGATION DID FOR FREE, AND CLIENT-SIDE ROUTING DOES NOT.
 *
 * A browser puts a newly loaded document at the top. Replacing page loads with in-app
 * navigation replaced that too, with nothing: the scroll offset of the page you left was
 * carried into the page you asked for. MEASURED IN CHROME ON THE BUILT ARTIFACT, the same
 * pair of pages from the same offset, differing only in how the navigation was made:
 *
 *     /terms at y=900  --full page load-->    /privacy   y = 0
 *     /terms at y=900  --click the link-->    /privacy   y = 900   (its maximum is 1881, so
 *                                                                   900 was carried, not clamped)
 *
 * and from the tallest gated address, /setup at its bottom, both /settings and /privacy opened
 * at their LAST line. See scrollReset.test.tsx for the full rows.
 *
 * ⚠ ON PUSH AND REPLACE ONLY — POP IS THE BROWSER'S AND IT ALREADY DOES IT RIGHT.
 * `history.scrollRestoration` is `auto` and, measured in the same session, back and forward
 * restore the offsets of these client-side entries exactly (900 and 300). A scroll-to-top on
 * every location change would break the half that works: the back button would drop a reader
 * at the top of a page they had read most of. A first mount is a POP too, so a deep link and a
 * reload are left alone as well.
 *
 * Layout effect, not effect: the reset happens before paint, so there is no frame in which the
 * new page is shown scrolled. `theme.css` never sets `scroll-behavior: smooth`, so this is an
 * instant jump rather than an animation the reader watches.
