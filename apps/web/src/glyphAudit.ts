/**
 * EVERY CHARACTER THIS PRODUCT RENDERS, ASKED OF THE FACES IT ACTUALLY SERVES.
 *
 * theme.css's own comment states the failure this guards, one level up from where it guards it:
 *
 *     ⚠ typeface.test.tsx asserts every url() below resolves to a file whose first four
 *     bytes are `wOF2`. A missing font file does not 404 loudly: the browser falls back
 *     to the system stack and the app renders in the wrong typeface forever.
 *
 * That is true of a missing FILE and equally true of a missing GLYPH, and only the first was
 * checked. A `@font-face` carries a `unicode-range`, the browser consults a face only for the
 * codepoints that range claims, and if the selected face's cmap has no glyph it falls through to
 * `ui-sans-serif, system-ui, …` / `ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, …` for that one character. No
 * error, no 404, no console warning — a single character in a different typeface, mid-word.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT FOUND ON THE FIRST RUN, at `f9f35ab` with every other design guard green: SIXTEEN
 * rendered occurrences of FOUR characters that no served face declares and none contains —
 *
 *     ≈  U+2248  ×6   Overview ×2, Spend, TopUp, BillingReturn, CacheCard
 *     ⚠  U+26A0  ×5   ConvertLens, Terms ×2, Privacy ×2
 *     ←  U+2190  ×3   IssueDetail "← Issues", docs "← Back", legal "← Back to Talyvor"
 *     →  U+2192  ×2   Setup, inside one instruction line
 *
 * ⚠ THE `≈` IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS AND IT IS INSIDE THE FIGURE FACE. Six money captions render
 * `<span class="font-figure …">≈ $12.35</span>`. The digits are IBM Plex Mono; the `≈` in front of
 * them is drawn by whatever the operating system supplies for `ui-monospace`. The element the whole
 * #93/#94/#95 architecture exists to put on ONE face renders its first character on another one.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE `⚠` IS WORSE IN A DIFFERENT WAY: with no glyph in either face, most platforms fall
 * through to the EMOJI font and paint a multicolour glyph — on two legal pages and the Convert
 * warning, in a language whose stated premise is one electric accent used sparingly.
 *
 * ⚠ IT READS THE DOM, AND THE REASON IS NOT THE USUAL ONE. A source sweep can find a character in
 * a string literal, but it cannot tell a rendered `≈` from the one inside figureAudit.ts's own
 * `DECORATION` regex — which renders nothing and would have to be exempted BY FILE, the curated
 * list #91 exists to warn about. The DOM has no such ambiguity: what renders is what renders.
 * It also settles the FAMILY, which decides which faces are consulted, and the family comes from
 * an ANCESTOR (`font-figure` on the span, the character three nodes down) — a fact no line-based
 * rule holds.
 *
 * ⚠ STATED LIMITS, NOT IMPLIED:
 *   (a) it rides apps/web's setup, so a surface with no test is audited by nothing — the same
 *       limit test-setup.ts already states for the other three audits, inherited rather than new;
 *   (b) it asks whether a glyph EXISTS, never whether it is the right shape.
 *
 * ⚠ AND ONE LIMIT I WROTE HERE WAS WRONG, WHICH THE FIRST RED PROVED IN THE SAME RUN. I had
 * written that tenant data is out of scope because "what is audited is the copy the product itself
 * ships, which in a test run is all there is". IT IS NOT. Two of the offenders arrive as DATA:
 * three emoji from Docs space `icon` fields, and a `→` inside Lens's server-sent
 * `reversible_note`, which the suite renders verbatim and cannot edit. A DOM audit sees what
 * renders and cannot see where it came from — so provenance is CLASSIFIED rather than inferred,
 * in the two tables below, and the sentence that assumed otherwise is corrected rather than
 * deleted.

// ── THE SERVED FACES, READ FROM THE BINARIES ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ⚠ THE COVERAGE IS PARSED OUT OF THE woff2 FILES, NOT DECLARED HERE. A hand-written list of
// "characters our fonts have" is a second copy of a fact that already exists, and the copy is the
// one that goes stale — `c71ca9c`'s two-copies-of-one-measurement, in glyphs. Re-subset a font and
// this guard's answer changes with it, because it re-reads the file.
//
// woff2 is a brotli-compressed sfnt with its own table directory. Only `glyf`/`loca` (and
// optionally `hmtx`) are TRANSFORMED; `cmap` is stored verbatim, so it can be sliced straight out
// of the decompressed stream at the sum of the preceding tables' stored lengths.
//
// ⚠ PROVENANCE OF THIS PARSER, because an instrument that quietly reads nothing is this repo's
// oldest trap and here it would fail in the SAFE direction (an empty cmap reds everything) while
// its opposite — a parser that over-reports — would go green for nothing. It was written against
// fontTools 4.63.0 as ground truth and agrees with it EXACTLY on all eight shipped files: not the
// counts, the SETS, all 2,090 codepoints, zero disagreement. glyphAudit.test.tsx pins both
// directions on real files (a character that is present, and one that is absent).
