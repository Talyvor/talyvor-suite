// meteredFaultClaim.test.tsx — WHAT A METERED CARD CLAIMS ABOUT MONEY WHEN THE CALL FAILS, AND
// WHY THE ONE STATUS IT CLAIMS IT ON CANNOT SUPPORT IT.
//
// ── THE STATE, MEASURED IN apps/bff RATHER THAN IMAGINED HERE ────────────────
//
// `502 {"error":"<product> upstream unreachable"}` was emitted by forwardProduct — the single
// `a.client.Do` every one of these nine surfaces reaches its upstream through — for TWO opposite
// causes: nothing listening, and an upstream that is running perfectly and has not finished.
// The second is not exotic. `a.client` is `&http.Client{Timeout: 10 * time.Second}`, and
// stream.go's own header measured what that bound does to a model call: "truncating every
// completion longer than that, WHICH IS MOST OF THEM". That fix moved the bound off
// `/api/ai/stream/{provider}` — the one AI route in this product that bills nobody — and left it
// on all nine that do.
//
// apps/bff/product_timeout_test.go reproduces it: a Docs upstream that answers 300ms after a 50ms
// bound produced byte-identical output to a connection refused. The BFF now separates them with
// `code: "UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT"`, the same discrimination docs_ai_test.go argued for one status down.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FILE PINS, AND WHY IT IS A RECORD RATHER THAN A REPAIR ─────────
//
// On that 502, five of the nine cards tell the reader that no work was done:
//
//   PageSummary / PageTranslation / PageTitleSuggestion / AskAI  "nothing was asked of the model"
//   AISummary                                                    "nothing was charged"
//
// On a TIMEOUT all five are false. The model was asked; it is still working; whether Lens took
// the charge is the upstream's to know and this app cannot see it. The other four make no money
// claim on a fault — FindDuplicates and TriageIssue say only "This is a fault, not an empty
// result", and the two searches say only that nothing was READ, which is true of the reader's
// screen either way.
//
// ⚠ THE COPY IS NOT CHANGED HERE AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Choosing what a reader should be told
// when the product does not know whether it billed them is a product decision on a money
// surface, and this repository's own answer already exists ONE CARD OVER, in SearchIssues' price
// note: "Track's answer carries no record either way, so this app cannot say whether this one was
// billed." Adopting that sentence on five shipping cards is a call for Nicolai, filed on W1.7.
// What lands here is the measurement, in a form that cannot be lost: the split is asserted in
// BOTH directions, so a sixth card acquiring the claim is loud, and so is the day someone takes
// the decision and this file has to change with the copy.

// ── THE RULE ALREADY EXISTS IN THIS REPOSITORY, ENFORCED ON TWO SURFACES OF NINE ──
//
// ⚠ THIS IS WHAT CONTROL T6 FOUND AND IT CHANGES WHAT THE FILE IS FOR. Making FindDuplicates say
// "nothing was charged" on a fault reds TWO tests: this census, and a PRE-EXISTING per-card test
// named "FindDuplicates — what each of Track's two shapes draws · a 500 says fault, and claims
// nothing about the money". So "a fault may not claim the money did not move" is not a rule this
// file is inventing. It was written down, and enforced, on the two Track mutation cards — and the
// four Docs write cards and AISummary say the opposite, with nothing watching. A rule held on the
// surfaces that already obey it and absent from the five that break it is the exact shape both
// metered censuses exist to end (W1.1.9a: "the fix applied where the defect was reported and the
// identical shape one element over never swept for").
//
// ── THE CONTROLS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 10 arms across BOTH suites, `~/talyvor-queue/w17-slow-model-fault-controls-m4x7.py`. Each
// applied ALONE, predicted catcher named FIRST, restored in a `finally` and sha256-verified.
// Verdicts from TEST NAMES, never exit codes.
//
//   T1   forwardProduct calls a timeout "unreachable" again  → 1 red  (the bff timeout test)
//   T1P  T1 with product_timeout_test.go DELETED             → 0 RED / 546 tests ← what shipped
//   T2   every failure gets the timeout code                 → 1 red  (the refused arm)
//   T3   the shipped 10s bound moved to 20s                  → 1 red  (the bound pin)
//   T4   the stream client gains a whole-exchange Timeout    → 2 red  (mine + a PRE-EXISTING one)
//   T5   PageSummary stops claiming                          → 2 red  (here + its own test)
//   T6   FindDuplicates STARTS claiming                      → 2 red  (here + the rule above)
//   T7   the stub stops failing (vacuity)                    → 9 red  (every row)
//   T8   the NO_WORK matcher made to match nothing           → 5 red  (4 rows + the pair)
//   T9   a row mis-classified HERE rather than in the card   → 2 red  (the floor + that row)
//   T10  a reworded comment                                  → 0 red
//
// ⚠ T1P IS THE FINDING: with the bff test absent, 546 tests pass while a healthy model past ten
// seconds is reported to the browser as an unreachable upstream.
//
// ⚠ T4's PREDICTION WAS WRONG AND THE CORRECTION IS WORTH MORE THAN THE PASS. I named one test;
// two reddened, because TestStream_AWholeExchangeClientTimeoutTruncatesTheStream already guards
// the stream direction. So half of what I thought was new was covered: the STREAM client was
// watched, and the SHARED client every metered route uses (T3) was not.
