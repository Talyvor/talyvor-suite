/**
 * THE OTHER DOOR.
 *
 * preset.ts opens by saying, of itself: "Every value the components may use is a NAMED token
 * here; arbitrary values (text-[#…], p-[13px]) are forbidden by local/no-arbitrary-value so
 * THIS FILE IS THE ONLY DOOR to the palette, scale, spacing and radii."
 *
 * ⚠ THE LOCK FORBIDS INVENTING A VALUE AND PERMITS REACHING PAST THE TOKEN TO TAILWIND'S OWN.
 * `local/no-arbitrary-value` fails on a `[...]` group — an ESCAPE. `rounded-lg` carries no
 * brackets, is a perfectly ordinary Tailwind utility, and lints clean. The preset uses
 * `theme.extend`, so every Tailwind default survives underneath the tokens: the door is the
 * only door nobody may CARVE, and it stands beside a door that was always open.
 *
 * MEASURED at 8555e1e, by asking the generator rather than by reading: Tailwind was run twice
 * over the same real content, once with the preset and once without, and every class the
 * source writes was classified. Three of the closed families held and one did not.
 *
 *   palette      0 bypasses.  Not one Tailwind hue anywhere in either package.
 *   type scale   0 bypasses.  Confirms `0292cf0`'s hand measurement, mechanically.
 *   radii       13 bypasses.  Five corner radii in a system that declares three.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE SHAPE OF THE THIRTEEN IS THE FINDING, NOT THE COUNT. Every one is a hand-rolled
 * twin of a design-system component that differs from the component ONLY by reaching past the
 * radius token:
 *
 *   Card.tsx      `overflow-hidden rounded-card border border-rule bg-surface`      10px
 *   Landing.tsx   `overflow-hidden rounded-lg   border border-rule bg-surface`  ×2   8px
 *
 *   Input.tsx     `h-8 w-full rounded-control border border-rule bg-surface px-2.5`  6px
 *   five hand-rolled text inputs and textareas, `rounded`                            4px
 *
 *   Pill.tsx      `h-1.5 w-1.5 shrink-0 rounded-pill`                            9999px
 *   Entry.tsx     `mt-2 h-1.5 w-1.5 shrink-0 rounded-full bg-accent`             9999px
 *
 * The Landing pair is byte-identical to Card's class list apart from the radius. The Entry dot
 * is byte-identical to Pill's dot apart from the radius and the fill. Same element, twice, one
 * on the scale and one beside it — the shape `7e2e9fc` found in the money figures, in corners.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS TEST WILL PASS BY FINDING NOTHING THE MOMENT THE THIRTEEN ARE FIXED, which is exactly
 * the condition the queue says to distrust. So the classification itself is asserted first, in
 * both directions and on known answers, and the sweep carries a floor: see NON-VACUITY below.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THE FIX DID TO THE SHIPPED SHEET, MEASURED RATHER THAN CLAIMED — 347 names to 345.
 * `rounded-lg` and `rounded-full` are gone. `rounded` IS NOT: six comments and one line of JSX
 * prose contain the English word "rounded" ("never rounded up into a friendlier number", "the
 * Talyvor mark: a rounded hairline tile"), and Tailwind's extractor reads raw text, so the
 * class survives with ZERO elements using it. That is W1.8, with a name on it — this merge
 * removes the last USE of a 4px corner and cannot remove the RULE, and says so rather than
 * selling a saving it did not make.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT ALMOST WENT THE OTHER WAY. The first before/after showed the
 * emitted set UNCHANGED, 369 both sides, which read as "the fix does nothing". It was the
 * INSTRUMENT: the guards resolve the config's content globs with `resolve()`, which destroys
 * the `!` negations, so both runs were scanning every test file — including this one, whose
 * docstring names `rounded-lg`. The guard was reading its own prose back as product. Fixed in
 * tailwind.config.ts (`absoluteContent`), used by deadClasses.test.ts too, and pinned by the
 * negation test below.
 *
 * POSITIVE CONTROLS — eight, each anchor-count-asserted BEFORE the edit, each observed, each
 * restored sha256-identical: regress a fixed site · a Tailwind type step · a Tailwind hue · a
 * radius nobody used before · blind the classifier · drop a closed family · widen the
 * exemption to a real hue · revert the glob fix. Eight red, none blind. ⚠ TWO OF THEM DID NOT
 * RUN THE FIRST TIME — the anchor assertion caught counts of 5 and 0 where I had written 1, so
 * they would have been a no-op and a wrong edit reported as evidence (#71's lesson, and it has
 * now paid for itself twice in this repo). ⚠ AND THE EXEMPTION CONTROL WAS GREEN-FOR-NOTHING
 * until the glob fix: it asked whether `border-black` is caught, and the only reason the class
 * was ever generated is that the broken content set was scanning this file's own source.

/**
 * THE SWEEP'S OTHER INPUT: WHICH FILES IT READS, AND IT WAS THE UNCONTROLLED ONE.
 *
 * Everything `collectUsedTokens` EXTRACTS is controlled above — the lookup-table harvest, the
 * comparison-operand rule, the interpolation stripper, the classifier on known answers. Nothing
 * controlled the WALK, and this sweep's output for "read nothing" is byte-identical to its output
 * for "read everything and found no bypass": `[]`.
 *
 * MEASURED at db85e4d on the real tree, not reasoned about
 * (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-blindwalk-controls-9e73.py` and `w11-blindwalk-armed-9e73.py`, every
 * mutation anchor-count-asserted before the edit, restored in a `finally` and verified back by
 * sha256, verdicts read from vitest's own per-test lines):
 *   A1  `rounded-lg` — a Tailwind default in the CLOSED borderRadius family, the exact class the
 *       docstring above records this repo removing — put back into a real screen at
 *       `areas/lens/Ledger.tsx`: REDS `nothing reaches past a closed door`, and only that case.
 *       So the comparison is armed on real production files.
 *   A2  THE HOLE: the same class, plus ONE line so the walk does not descend into `areas` —
 *       rc=0, GREEN. 43 of the 70 production files under apps/web/src live there, which is
 *       every product screen.
 *   C3  the skip ALONE, no bypass: GREEN. Nothing anywhere notices the population shrank.
 *
 * That is #183's C1/C2/C3, in this file. #183 closed it in `lib/awaiting.test.ts` and named the
 * three sweeps it had not been run against; this is one of them.
 *
 * THE REPAIR IS #183's AND IT IS THRESHOLD-FREE — an INDEPENDENT ENUMERATION, not a bigger floor.
 * The floors here are already substantive (`>150` used tokens, `>40` token classes) and all three
 * are satisfied by the 27 files that survive the skip, so raising a number would be a threshold
 * nobody measured. `import.meta.glob` is resolved by Vite at transform time and touches `node:fs`
 * not at all, so a skip map, a changed extension filter or a wrong `roots` cannot move both
 * instruments the same way. The two sets are compared BOTH DIRECTIONS. The floor is there for the
 * one failure that CAN move both: an anchor resolving to an empty tree leaves the two
 * enumerations agreeing on nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ IT PASSED ON ITS FIRST RUN, so every assertion in it has its own control and every verdict is
 * read from the FAILING TEST NAME rather than from the file's exit code
 * (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-blindwalk-guard-controls-9e73.py`, 7/7):
 *   P1 walk skips `areas/` → the SET comparison reds and it is the ONLY newly-failing case, so the
 *      catch is this block's and not something else noticing.
 *   P2 the glob pattern pointed at a directory that does not exist → the FLOOR *and* the SET red,
 *      so the floor is armed rather than decorative.
 *   P3 the walk widened to keep `.test.*` → the SET reds. ⚠ AND ONLY THE SET, HERE: unlike
 *      deadClasses.test.ts, whose own negative-control fixture is a list of dead classes, nothing
 *      in this repo's test files reads as a closed-door bypass. Recorded because it is the one
 *      place the three files' controls disagree.
 *   P4 the `rounded-lg` defect with the walk intact → the ORIGINAL guard reds ALONE and the SET
 *      stays green, so the repair was ADDED to the sweep rather than swapped in for it.
 *   P5 the A2 combination → CAUGHT. The flip is the finding.
 *   P6 BLINDING: this block skipped and the A2 defect restored → rc=0, NOT CAUGHT. Nothing else
 *      in the repo was watching.
 *   G1 a new production file that both instruments can see → STAYS GREEN. It is a set comparison,
 *      not a snapshot of a file list somebody would have to re-baseline.
