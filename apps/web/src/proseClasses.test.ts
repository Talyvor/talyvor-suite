/**
 * A CLASS THAT EXISTS BECAUSE A SENTENCE MENTIONS IT.
 *
 * Tailwind's extractor reads RAW TEXT. It cannot tell a class from a paragraph about a class,
 * so the comment explaining why a utility is banned COMPILES THAT UTILITY INTO PRODUCTION CSS.
 * `5d65b3e` took test files out of the content set and `dc0bd07` stopped the instruments from
 * silently putting them back; neither touched comments in ordinary source, and tailwind.config.ts
 * said so in writing rather than fixing it. This is that fix and this is its guard.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED ON THIS TREE before the fix, by generating base+components+utilities twice over the
 * SAME file set — once raw, once with comments stripped before extraction — and diffing the
 * emitted class names:
 *
 *     shipped class names, raw:        363     28,452 bytes
 *     with comments stripped:          343     26,226 bytes
 *     supplied ONLY by prose:           20      2,226 bytes
 *
 * The twenty: `p-[13px]`, `text-[#2026]`, `leading-[1.04]`, `tracking-[-0.03em]`,
 * `active:scale-[0.98]`, `scale-95`, `tabular-nums`, `tracking-wide`, `transition`, `inline`,
 * `fixed`, `grow`, `invisible`, `outline`, `shadow`, `collapse`, `container`, `bg-accent-hover`,
 * and the junk fragments `025em;` and `95;`. `p-[13px]` is preset.ts's own opening sentence —
 * "arbitrary values (text-[#…], p-[13px]) are forbidden by local/no-arbitrary-value" — shipping
 * the exact arbitrary value the lint rule exists to forbid, supplied by the rule's own
 * documentation.
 *
 * ⚠ AND MEASURED ON THE ARTEFACT, not only on the generator — `vite build` run both ways:
 *     dist/assets/index-*.css   24,098 -> 22,420 bytes   (gzipped 5,760 -> 5,449)
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS A CORRECTNESS ARGUMENT, NOT A PERFORMANCE ONE. 311 bytes off a gzipped stylesheet
 * is not a saving anyone can measure. What matters is that the stylesheet should describe the
 * PRODUCT, and a rule nothing renders is a rule review cannot distinguish from one something
 * renders — `.bg-accent-hover` reads in the sheet exactly like a live token, and no element in
 * this repo asks for it.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT MOVED FOR deadClasses.test.ts, which reasons from this same emitted set (utilities
 * only, its own scope): emitted 346 -> 325, and the tokens it harvests 282 -> 281. The one it
 * lost is `04` — a junk fragment that was emitted from a comment, which made rule B (a literal
 * is a class list if any of its tokens is a real class) read one more literal as classes. Its
 * dead list is unchanged: `tal-range`, `tal-rise`, `tal-stagger`, all hand-written CSS and all
 * filtered. No class the source writes stopped being emitted.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. `index.html` is in the content set
 * and HTML comments are NOT stripped: `stripComments` is a JavaScript scanner (it protects
 * string and template literals so `https://…` is not read as a comment opener) and pointing it
 * at HTML would be a second stripper with a different syntax. Measured on this tree, adding an
 * HTML-comment transformer changes the emitted set by NOTHING — 343 names, 26,226 bytes, byte
 * identical — because the one comment index.html carries ("No-flash theme: set data-theme before
 * first paint…") holds no token Tailwind recognises. So the hole is real, currently empty, and
 * unguarded; `html` is listed in EXEMPT below with that reason, and the coverage test will name
 * it again the day a second HTML file joins the content set.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE SECOND HOLE IS NOT EMPTY ANY MORE — A CLASS SUPPLIED BY A STRING LITERAL. This file
 * strips COMMENTS, and `stripComments` deliberately PROTECTS string and template literals,
 * because a string literal is exactly where a real class list lives (`className="text-body"`).
 * So a utility name written as DATA rather than as a class is present in BOTH generations, the
 * diff is empty, and this guard is green while the browser downloads the rule.
 *
 * MEASURED, on this repo, from `src/fieldFaceAudit.ts`: `new Set(['range', 'hidden'])` — an
 * exemption list of INPUT TYPES, where `hidden` is an HTML attribute value that happens to spell
 * a Tailwind utility — put `.hidden{display:none}` into the production stylesheet for an element
 * that does not exist. On the built artifact: 22,420 → 22,441 bytes, 308 → 309 emitted class
 * names, and the diff of the two name sets was exactly `hidden`. That file now spells it
 * `` `hid${'den'}` `` and carries the four-way measurement of which spellings leak.
 *
 * ⚠ IT IS RECORDED HERE AND DELIBERATELY NOT CLOSED. The check this file makes is cheap because
 * "with comments" and "without comments" are both mechanically derivable from one source; there
 * is no such second derivation for "with data strings" — telling a class list from a data string
 * is the same problem deadClasses.test.ts's rule B already wrestles with, and every wrong answer
 * either red-flags a live class list or silently permits the next `hidden`. Whoever takes it
 * should start from that rule rather than from a new scanner.

 * rather than passing quietly), and it must be ABSENT from the sheet the build produces.
 *
 * The split is deliberate and it is what makes a missing transformer visible. `p-[13px]`,
 * `leading-[1.04]`, `tracking-[-0.03em]` and `tabular-nums` come from packages/ui/src/preset.ts,
 * a `.ts` file. `transition` comes only from `.tsx` comments — measured: register a
 * transformer for `ts` alone and exactly six classes come back, `transition` among them. A
 * one-key transform map is therefore red here, and green everywhere else in the repo.
 *
 * `inline` was listed beside it until B2.1: the Docs editor's ProseMirror schema writes the word
 * in CODE (`inline: true`, `group: 'inline'`), so it is extracted from source and ships, and it is
 * no longer a class only prose asks for.
