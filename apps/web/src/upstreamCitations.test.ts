/**
 * A CROSS-REPO LINE CITATION IS A CLAIM THAT DECAYS WITHOUT ANY LOCAL CHANGE, AND THIS ONE DECAYED
 * INTO THREE CONTRADICTORY ANSWERS.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED, NOT SUSPECTED. Eight comments in this repo cited talyvor-track's
 * `internal/model/model.go` by LINE, and they disagreed with each other about where ONE enum
 * lives:
 *
 *     model.go:94-98    IssueList.tsx, IssueList.test.tsx ×2      IssuePriority
 *     model.go:65-73    areas/track/format.ts, types.ts           IssuePriority
 *     model.go:113-120  issueVocabulary.test.tsx                  IssuePriority   ← the only true one
 *     model.go:54-63    areas/track/format.ts, types.ts           IssueStatus
 *
 * Measured against talyvor-track at HEAD: `type IssuePriority` is at 113 with its constants at
 * 116-120, and `type IssueStatus` is at 57 with its constants at 60-65. So SEVEN of the eight were
 * wrong, and the two failure modes are both worse than merely stale:
 *
 *   · `model.go:65-73` now spans `StatusCancelled`, a closing paren and `ImporterCreatorID` — a
 *     reader following the priority citation lands on an UNRELATED constant.
 *   · `model.go:54-63` now ENDS at `StatusInReview`, so a reader following the status citation
 *     sees FOUR of the six values and has every reason to think this repo's six-value list is
 *     wrong.
 *
 * ⚠ AND NOBODY WAS CARELESS — THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. At `a3bc7b2`, the commit `types.ts` says
 * this repo mirrors, `IssueStatus` WAS at 54-63 and `IssuePriority` WAS at 65-73. Both citations
 * were exactly right when written. Upstream inserted three lines above the status enum and moved
 * priority forty-eight lines down, and every one of these comments became false with no commit in
 * this repo touching them. (`94-98` matches neither commit measured — a third answer from a third
 * moment.) There is no review that catches this and no local test that can fail for it: the
 * premise lives in another repository, so the number is unverifiable from here BY CONSTRUCTION.
 *
 * ⚠ SO THE FIX IS NOT BETTER NUMBERS. Correcting them to today's truth re-arms the same trap on
 * the next upstream insert — the `113-120` citation above is already the correct-today form and
 * will rot exactly like its siblings. A SYMBOL survives edits: `type IssuePriority` is greppable
 * upstream, cannot silently point at a different declaration, and stays true when the file moves.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARD CLAIMS, precisely: no comment in the scanned tree cites talyvor-track's
 * `model.go` by line. It does NOT claim the symbol names are right — that premise still lives in
 * another repo and this file cannot check it. It makes the UNVERIFIABLE form impossible for the
 * one file whose decay was root-caused, which is the half that is checkable from here.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE SCOPE IS NARROWER THAN THE PROBLEM, SAID OUT LOUD SO IT IS NOT READ AS COVERAGE. The
 * same scan, unrestricted, finds 44 Go line citations across 24 distinct upstream paths in at
 * least three repositories (talyvor-lens `internal/proxy/proxy.go`, `internal/alerts/alerts.go`,
 * `internal/economy/*`, `internal/mining/*`, `internal/poolroyalty/*`, `cmd/lens/main.go`, …;
 * talyvor-track `internal/issue/store.go`). Every one of them decays the same way. They are
 * MEASURED AND NOT FIXED HERE: correcting comments in files this session did not read would be a
 * wide diff resting on no measurement. A future session widening `CITED_FILE` should re-measure
 * rather than trust this paragraph's numbers.
 *
 * ⚠ NOT EVERY Go CITATION IS THE SAME CLASS, AND THE OTHER CLASS IS NOW CHECKED. `apps/bff/lens.go:906`
 * and `apps/bff/billing.go:300` name a file IN THIS REPOSITORY, so they are verifiable from here
 * and stay out of this rule's scope. This paragraph used to end "a guard could actually check
 * them", and none did — `pointerAudit.test.ts`'s POINTER regex covered `.tsx|.ts|.css|.mjs|.js`
 * and not `.go`. MEASURED at `eb051cd`: the `billing.go` citation was right when written at
 * `31095b7` and a LOCAL commit moved the comment it named twenty lines, so it pointed inside
 * `probeBillingEnabled` — the one function on that path that cannot charge anyone — while the
 * `TopUp.tsx:29` citation in the SAME PARENTHESIS was pinned and green. `pointerAudit` now
 * resolves in-repo `.go` pointers and pins both of these, which is what this paragraph asked for.
 * The cross-repo half is unchanged: it is still unreachable from here, and still banned rather
 * than checked.

/**
 * THE WALK'S OWN POPULATION, ASSERTED AGAINST AN INSTRUMENT THAT DOES NOT SHARE ITS MACHINERY.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED, NOT SUSPECTED (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-areasprune-census-3a6d.py`). Rule A is an
 * ABSENCE sweep, and its own floor says so — but the floor names five files, none of them under
 * `areas/lens`. Armed with a real `model.go:54-63` citation planted in a real file there:
 *   A1  the citation with the tree whole          → this file REDS.
 *   A2  the same citation, `areas/lens` unreachable → GREEN. 23 of the 69 production files under
 *       apps/web/src (33%) stopped being read and neither the floor nor rule A noticed.
 * `all.length > 80` is satisfied by the files that survive, and every named anchor is in
 * `areas/track` or `packages/ui`, so ADDING ONE MORE NAMED FILE IS THE WRONG REPAIR: it would
 * arm this rule for `areas/lens` and leave the next area exactly as blind.
 *
 * ⚠ AND NO SECOND INSTRUMENT WAS WATCHING: this file's test count is FIXED at 3, so unlike
 * `packages/ui/src/__tests__/invariant.test.ts` — which generates one `it()` per file and whose
 * 104 → 81 drop test-manifest.json catches — losing a whole product area moved nothing here.
 *
 * THE REPAIR IS #183's AND IT IS THRESHOLD-FREE. `import.meta.glob` is resolved by Vite at
 * transform time and touches `node:fs` not at all, so a wrong root, a changed extension filter or
 * a walk that stops descending cannot move both instruments the same way. Compared BOTH
 * DIRECTIONS. The floor is for the one failure that CAN move both: an anchor resolving to an
 * empty tree leaves the two enumerations agreeing on nothing.

   * distinct upstream paths** — the header says 44 across 24. It grew, and it will keep growing.
   *
   * ⚠ AND THE DECAY IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. Every citation in `areas/lens/spendMath.ts` was resolved
   * against the real talyvor-lens tree at `a04310a`. Nine were true. TWO WERE FALSE, and both are
   * load-bearing on the LXC spend math:
   *
   *   · it cited a position inside `SpendLXCForAgent` for a statement it QUOTES verbatim — "a
   *     bound, NOT a bill … revenue readers MUST exclude it". That position is a BLANK LINE; the
   *     statement is 45 lines away, on the `LXCTypeReservationHold` constant. That quote is the
   *     entire justification for the allow-list rule that replaced a sign test, after real rows
   *     summed 8,380 where 1,840 was spent. A reader checking whether Lens still says it lands on
   *     nothing and may put the sign rule back.
   *   · it cited a position in `dualtoken.go` as one of three writers that "require a positive
   *     amount". That position is a bare closing brace of an unrelated nil-check inside
   *     `DualTokenStore.SpendLXC`; the guard is two lines above it. That claim is why
   *     `splitShortfall` is allowed to go negative.
   *   (Both are named in words rather than in the banned spelling — rule D below sweeps this file
   *   too, and these two sentences are the reason it had to.)
   *
   * ⚠ WHY THIS IS A PER-FILE OPT-IN AND NOT A TREE-WIDE BAN. A tree-wide ban is the right end
   * state and it forces ~50 rewrites at once, including line-RANGE citations that name three
   * adjacent route registrations (`cmd/lens/main.go` lines 1832-1835, 1869-1871, 1878-1879) and
   * have no clean symbol form. Converting comments in files nobody re-measured is the wide diff
   * resting on no measurement this file's header already refused once. So the rule takes the shape
   * this repo chose for the same problem in `formatterReach` — a per-module opt-in — and a file
   * joins the list only when EVERY citation in it has been resolved against the upstream tree.
   *
   * SO A PASS HERE IS NOT COVERAGE, AND THE LIST SAYS SO: one file is enrolled. The other ~26
   * upstream paths are a census handed to the queue, not a swept set.
   *
   * WHAT IT CLAIMS: an enrolled file cites no Go file by line — not upstream, and not this repo's
   * own `apps/bff`, because "verifiable in principle" is not "verified" and nothing verifies them.

   *
   * ⚠ MEASURED at merged main `766427d`, by re-running the census rule C's note asks a widening
   * session to re-run rather than trust. #198 resolved every citation in `areas/lens/spendMath.ts`
   * against the real Lens tree and found two false ones on the LXC spend math. One of them — the
   * pre-serve-hold quote, cited at a position in `agent_subbudget.go` that is a BLANK LINE — is
   * copied VERBATIM into `areas/lens/spendHolds.test.tsx`, quote and number together. That is the
   * file whose entire subject IS the defect the quote justifies: the panel that summed every
   * negative row and read 8,380 where 1,840 was spent.
   *
   * Rule C could not see it, and not by accident: its population is a list of FILE names, and
   * that file is not on the list. The repair landed on the file somebody read, and the identical
   * false claim one directory entry away stayed false.
   *
   * ⚠ SO THE UNIT WAS WRONG. What #198 established is not a fact about `spendMath.ts`. It is a
   * fact about an upstream PATH: every citation in this tree naming `agent_subbudget.go` was
   * walked against the real Lens source. That fact does not belong to the file that happened to
   * carry it. Once a path is resolved, no file here may cite it by line — and a NEW file cannot
   * arrive carrying the old pointer, which is the case a file list structurally cannot pose.
   *
   * WHAT IS ENROLLED AND WHY ONLY THAT. The two paths #198 resolved. Enrolling a path means
   * every citation of it in the tree has been walked upstream; measured at Lens `a04310a`, that
   * is seven sites across four files, and ONE of the seven was false. The other ~25 upstream
   * paths in the census are still a census — a pass here is not coverage and the list says so.
   *
   * ⚠ IT BANS THE PROSE SPELLING TOO, AND THAT IS NOT PEDANTRY. `some_upstream.go, line 191` is
   * exactly as unverifiable as the same path with a colon and 191, and rule C's regex cannot see
   * it — so with only the colon form banned, a future author "converts" a citation by deleting
   * one character and the pointer stays as false as it was. Measured: that spelling is live in
   * this tree today (this file used it twice, and `apps/bff/cited_lines_test.go` uses it for two
   * paths that are NOT enrolled).
   *
   * ⚠ NO SELF-EXEMPTION, AND IT COST THIS FILE TWO LINES. Rule A skips its own file because its
   * prose quotes the dead `model.go` form. Rule D does not skip anything: the two sentences above
   * that used to name these paths in the prose spelling now name the position in words instead.
   * Excluding the guard would leave unswept exactly the file most likely to carry an example.
