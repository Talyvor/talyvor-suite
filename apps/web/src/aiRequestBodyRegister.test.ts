/**
 * THE REQUEST BODIES THIS REPO BUILDS ARE CROSS-REPO SHAPE CLAIMS, AND NOTHING ASKED
 * talyvor-docs ABOUT THEM.
 *
 * ── THE SECOND FINDING, AND IT IS ABOUT THIS FILE (tab-5d2a) ─────────────────
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THE TABLE BELOW WAS HAND-MAINTAINED AND ITS COMPLETENESS RULE RAN IN ONE DIRECTION ONLY.
 * It asked "does every register entry have a row" and never "does every body have a row", so a
 * body this repository builds, marshals and sends could sit outside the register with nothing
 * failing. One did. `apps/bff/docs_changelog.go#docsGenerateBody` is the FOURTH Go struct this BFF
 * marshals into a Docs request body; three of the four were in here and it was not — not by
 * judgement, but because the sweep that produced this table read `internal/ai/handler.go`, and
 * changelog binds its keys in `internal/changelog/handler.go`. The population boundary WAS the
 * hole.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE HARM IS NOT THE AI HARM, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS WORTH FINDING RATHER THAN ASSUMING.
 * Changelog generation is not a metered call at all (docs_changelog.go records that measurement).
 * MEASURED BY EXECUTING docs' own `changelog.Handler.Generate` at `8189d7b5`, in a `git archive`
 * scratch export — that repo was held by another tab and was NEVER written to:
 *
 *     {"version":"v1.2.3","issue_ids":[]}  → 201 Created, ZERO Track lookups,
 *                                            a durable row summarised "Generated from 0 issues"
 *
 * and `…/changelog/entries/{id}/publish` pushes that row into the workspace's PUBLIC RSS feed. So
 * an upstream rename of `issue_ids` is not an error anywhere: this BFF's own empty-list refusal
 * reads the BROWSER's key, not the wire's, and every generated entry quietly becomes an empty
 * release note that can be published. That is the 201-shaped sibling of the 200-shaped defect the
 * four AI rows exist for.
 *
 * ⚠ THE FIX IS THE POPULATION, NOT THE ROW. `marshalCensus()` derives the go-struct half from
 * `json.Marshal(<Name>{` across `apps/bff`, so the table is now held to the source rather than to
 * a memory of which files were swept. Adding the changelog row alone would have left the next
 * body to be found by the next sweep.
 *
 * ── THE FINDING THIS EXISTS FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `mirrorSubsetRegister.test.ts` next door covers the RESPONSE shapes this app mirrors — the
 * structs in each area's `types.ts` and in `lib/api.ts`. The REQUEST bodies this repo builds for the AI
 * routes are the same kind of claim about another repository, and they were not in it. They are
 * the worse half of the pair, for a reason this repo has already paid for once:
 *
 *   #234 measured that `POST /v1/workspaces/{ws}/ai/suggest-title` binds `content`, while its two
 *   siblings bind `text`. A body sending `text` there is NOT an error upstream. Measured against
 *   docs' own handler over a Lens that counts completions:
 *
 *       {"text":"Some real page text.","page_id":"pg-1"}  → 200, 1 completion, 0 user bytes
 *
 *   A wrong key on these routes is a 200 with a real billed completion that read NOTHING. There
 *   is no status code, no error body and no response field that separates it from a correct call,
 *   which is why a black-box assertion cannot be the guard here.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE EXISTING TESTS CANNOT SEE IT, WHICH IS THE POINT. `docs_suggesttitle_test.go`,
 * `docs_summarize_test.go` and `docs_translate_test.go` each decode the SENT body — the right
 * instrument — but they decode it through struct tags TRANSCRIBED INTO THIS REPOSITORY. Rename a
 * key in talyvor-docs and every one of them stays green, because both halves of the comparison
 * live here. The claim they check is "this app sends what this app believes"; the claim that
 * matters is "this app sends what DOCS BINDS", and no test in this repository can check it: CI
 * checks out this repository alone.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GUARD CLAIMS, PRECISELY ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It does NOT claim any body matches its upstream — nothing here can. It claims ONE link, the
 * same one `mirrorSubsetRegister.test.ts` claims for responses: the key set the deployer's
 * command asks talyvor-docs about is the key set this repository actually sends. An entry naming
 * a stale set settles the wrong question and reports a pass for it.
 *
 * The command in the register greps the upstream's OWN bind tags out of talyvor-docs and compares
 * them to that set, so both halves are `git grep`-able truth rather than prose. ⚠ THIS SENTENCE
 * NAMED ONE FILE AND IS CORRECTED IN PLACE RATHER THAN LEFT (tab-5d2a): it read "out of
 * `internal/ai/handler.go`", which was true of all four rows when it was written and is exactly
 * the assumption that hid the fifth. The file is a COLUMN on each row now, and the subject may be
 * a handler FUNCTION (the AI four decode into an anonymous struct inside it) or a named TYPE
 * (changelog declares one beside the handler).
 *
 * ⚠ WHY EQUALITY AND NOT "WE SEND A SUBSET". A key docs binds and this app does not send is not
 * harmless: on these routes an absent key is a DEFAULT, not a refusal — `Engine.Translate`
 * substitutes `defaultLang = "English"` on a blank, so a translation nobody asked for in English
 * is a 200 and a billed completion. So an unsent bound key must be DECLARED
 * (`UPSTREAM-BINDS-ONLY <subject>: none`) in the file that builds the body, and the union is what
 * the register asks about. `none` is spelled out: a missing declaration must be distinguishable
 * from an empty one, and an absent line is a red.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, said out loud so the scope is not mistaken for coverage. A key renamed in
 * BOTH this repo and the register in one change is not a red here — the two halves still agree,
 * and from inside this repository that is indistinguishable from a correct rename. Only running
 * the register's command in a talyvor-docs checkout tells those apart. That direction is the
 * register's whole job and is why these entries exist at all.
 *
 * ⚠ AND A SECOND POPULATION IT DOES NOT TOUCH, NAMED SO THE SCOPE IS NOT MISTAKEN FOR COVERAGE.
 * Some of this BFF's `forwardProduct` calls pass the caller's own `r.Body` straight through:
 * those shapes are authored by the browser, not here, so no Go struct in `apps/bff` names them
 * and the census below cannot see them. That is a boundary, not a clean bill of health.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THIS PARAGRAPH SAID "SIX (`lens.go` ×3, `track.go` ×3)" AND ENDED "nothing in this
 * repository asks talyvor-docs about the `lens.go` three". BOTH HALVES ARE CORRECTED IN PLACE
 * (tab-6d9a) RATHER THAN LEFT, because a guard now contradicts them and a reader believes
 * whichever they read first.
 *
 *   · THE COUNT IS FIVE, NOT SIX. `git grep -n 'http.MaxBytesReader(w, r.Body' apps/bff` returns
 *     six lines, and the FIRST is `lens.go:1004` — inside `docsSpaceCreateBody`, which reads the
 *     body precisely so it can REWRITE `workspace_id` and is the one place this BFF explicitly
 *     does NOT forward a Docs body verbatim (its own docstring says so). Counting a read of the
 *     body as a verbatim forward is what made the trio look like a trio. It is `lens.go` ×2 —
 *     `docsCreatePage` (POST) and `docsUpdatePage` (PATCH) — and `track.go` ×3.
 *
 *   · AND ALL OF THEM ARE ASKED NOW. `track.go`'s three are in the register; `lens.go`'s two are
 *     covered by `docsPageWriteRegister.test.ts` and the three `internal/page` entries in
 *     `deploy/decision-expiry.sh` — the UPDATE allowlist, the CREATE binding, and (tab-6d9a) the
 *     LIST return type behind `stripPageContentList`'s by-name deletes.
 *
 * (The anonymous-marshal family this census bucketed and could not name is owned by
 * `lensRequestBodyRegister.test.ts`, which holds the six that go to talyvor-lens and shares this
 * file's population rather than counting its own.)
 *
 * ⚠ THE FLOORS ARE NOT DECORATION. Every half is parsed out of source, so a rename, a reformat or
 * a deleted entry yields no match — at which point a set equality over two empty sets passes
 * having read nothing. Every body parse asserts it found EXACTLY ONE subject; the marshal census
 * asserts it found at least one site before comparing anything (control G6 blanks the pattern and
 * the guard goes RED rather than green); the register is asserted to hold EXACTLY as many
 * request-body entries as this table has rows; and the marshalled bodies this guard does NOT
 * cover are pinned at a literal so the uncovered set cannot widen in silence.
 *
 * ⚠ MEASURED AGAINST talyvor-docs `d35f6406f0c9ca890929efbb3d8ff029dd4c4567` (the AI four, tab-a91c)
 * and re-measured against `8189d7b53892f7f37e9756c5fe68e3cdd2c547da` (tab-5d2a), read-only in a
 * `git archive` scratch export (that repo was held by another tab and was NEVER written to). ALL
 * FIVE commands pass there today — the four AI ones re-run rather than inherited from the older
 * SHA, and the changelog one new.
 *
 * ⚠ CONTROLS. tab-a91c's six on the AI entries; and 17/17 for this change,
 * `~/talyvor-queue/w17-marshalcensus-controls-5d2a.py`, verdict predicted BEFORE each run and every
 * mutation restored in a `finally` and sha256-verified back. Guard side: a new marshalled body
 * with no row, the changelog row deleted while the marshal stays, the register command re-aimed,
 * a sixth entry with no row, the declaration deleted, the register expectation narrowed, the
 * census pattern blanked (vacuity), a tenth uncovered site, and a SIBLING struct renamed in the Go
 * only — all RED; a reworded comment — GREEN. Register side, mutating the docs export: `issue_ids`
 * renamed, a key added, `workspace_id` dropped, the TYPE renamed and the handler file EMPTIED —
 * all RED, the last two being the vacuity cases a command that finds nothing must not pass.
