/**
 * ConsoleNavLinks.test.tsx — TEN OF THE TWELVE DESTINATIONS IN THE CONSOLE'S PRIMARY NAVIGATION
 * WERE NOT LINKS. They were `<button>`s that called `navigate()`, so they carried no `href`.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS MEASURED, IN THE DOM AND BY ACTIVATION ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A throwaway probe drove the real `<App />` to all twelve gated addresses. At each one it clicked
 * every `<button>` on the page in turn, from a freshly mounted app, and recorded which ones changed
 * `location.pathname`:
 *
 *     every gated address        9 or 10 buttons change the address on click, and none has an href
 *     nav[aria-label=Sections]   2 of 12 destinations were `<a href>`   (Privacy, Terms)
 *                               10 of 12 were `<button>`               (Overview, Ledger, Billing,
 *                                                                       Setup, API keys, Spend &
 *                                                                       routing, Members, Settings,
 *                                                                       Track, Docs)
 *
 * The two that were links are the two legal documents in the footer of the sidebar. The ten that
 * were not are every product destination in the application.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A DEFECT AND NOT A PREFERENCE, IN THE PRODUCT'S OWN WORDS ────────────
 *
 * The rule is not one this file invented. It is written down twice in the codebase already, and
 * applied both times to something smaller than the primary navigation:
 *
 *   · `App.tsx`, on the Privacy/Terms pair: "Link, not <a href>: same-tab client-side navigation,
 *     and it keeps a real href so the link is a link to assistive tech and to a middle-click."
 *   · `areas/docs/components.tsx`, on `BackButton`: "A REAL <button>, not a Link wearing button
 *     styling. … the crumb beside it is already the link, and already carries the link semantics
 *     worth having (cmd-click, open in a new tab)."
 *
 * So the product argues, in two places, that a destination should be a link and that cmd-click and
 * open-in-a-new-tab are the semantics worth having — while the ten destinations every person uses
 * on every screen had none of them. What a `<button onClick={navigate}>` cannot do, measured as
 * capability rather than as markup: it cannot be cmd/ctrl-clicked into a new tab, it cannot be
 * middle-clicked at all (middle click raises `auxclick`, never `click`), it has no context-menu
 * "Open link in new tab" or "Copy link address", it shows no destination in the status bar, and it
 * is announced as a button — so a screen reader's LINKS list, on every screen behind the gate,
 * offered Privacy and Terms and no way to reach any part of the product.
 *
 * ── THE FIX USES THE COMPONENT'S OWN ESTABLISHED SEAM ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `Button` in the same package has carried `asChild` (Radix `Slot`) since it was written. `NavItem`
 * gains exactly that, and `App.tsx` renders `<NavItem asChild><Link to={…}/></NavItem>`. No class
 * moves and no element is added: the same class string lands on an `<a href>` instead of a
 * `<button>`, and react-router's `Link` is what already decides that a plain click is a client-side
 * navigation while a modified click is the browser's to handle.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE ASSERTS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A TAG-NAME CHECK ───────────────────────
 *
 * ⚠ THE LAST DESCRIBE BLOCK IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS. Asserting `<a href>` would pass for an anchor
 * that navigates on every click including a cmd-click — which is a button in an anchor's clothing
 * and delivers none of the capability above. So the capability is asserted directly, by activation:
 * a plain click must navigate WITHOUT leaving the app, and a meta/ctrl-modified click must NOT
 * navigate in-app at all, because that click belongs to the browser. A `<button onClick>` fails the
 * second case for the reason the reader cares about — it steals the modified click.
 *
 * ⚠ AND EVERY COUNT CARRIES A FLOOR. "every destination is a link" is also what a sidebar that
 * rendered nothing reports. The destination count is pinned by the LIST below rather than by a
 * number in this sentence, and the pinned list is cross-checked against `App.tsx`'s own call
 * sites, so neither adding a destination nor deleting one leaves this sweep quietly reporting on a
 * set it no longer covers. (It read "pinned at twelve" until W4.6.1 step 7 added /earnings and made
 * that thirteen — a cardinal in prose beside a list that already states it is one more thing to
 * keep true, so it is gone rather than incremented.)
