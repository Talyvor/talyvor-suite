// Every failing panel used to render "Couldn't load <thing>." — correct for a genuine fault and
// a misdiagnosis for an expired credential. These two components put that decision in ONE place
// so a panel cannot hold an opinion about a cause it cannot see.
//
// On an expired session they render a neutral placeholder and nothing else: the bar above has
// already said what happened and what to do, and a card repeating it is the eighth voice this
// change exists to remove. Deliberately a WORD and not a dash — "—" in a slot that usually holds
// a number reads as zero, and a balance that says zero when it is merely unknown is the worst
// available answer.
//
// AND DELIBERATELY NOT "Unavailable while signed out." This first said exactly that, which is a
// second (quieter, differently-worded) diagnosis of the one cause — seven of them, under a bar
// that had already given the first. The "say it once" test failed on my own implementation of
// the thing it exists to prevent, which is the clearest evidence that the rule is easy to break
// while believing you are keeping it. The placeholder states availability, never a reason.
