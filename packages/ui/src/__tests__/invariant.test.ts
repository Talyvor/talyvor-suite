// THE INVARIANT, enforced statically: the mined/pegged/status hues (lens, lxc, the
// tiers, settled/held/slashed) NEVER colour text — they appear only as bg/dot/
// tick/bar affordances. If anything ever writes `text-lens` (etc.), this fails.
// (accent lives on icons + accent-ink on the primary button; those are affordance
// ink, not hued words — see README §The invariant.)
//
// ⚠ ITS SCOPE WAS packages/ui/src/components ALONE, AND THAT WAS THE HOLE.
// The rule is stated as a property of the whole product, and it was checked on one
// directory. Four screens outside it had reached for a hue on text — `text-danger` in
// Documents, Sharing and IssueDetail, `text-warn` in the legal notice, `text-negative`
// in Setup — and the ONLY reason none of them broke the invariant visibly is that all
// five names were dead classes that generated no CSS. The guard was not holding the
// line; a typo was. Both are fixed, in the same change that widened this.
//
// Widening cost nothing at the time it was widened — there were zero live violations
// outside the components directory once the dead names were corrected. A guard whose
// scope is smaller than its claim is a guard that will be right until it matters.
