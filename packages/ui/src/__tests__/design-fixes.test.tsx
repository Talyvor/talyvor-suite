// The four deployed-app corrections, pinned at the design-system layer.

/**
 * ⚠ CORRECTION 1 HAS BEEN REVERSED, and the reversal is deliberate rather than a drift.
 *
 * It used to read "numerals are SANS with tabular figures; mono is for identifiers", on the
 * premise that mono was a FOREIGN face here — it appeared only on SHAs, key prefixes and
 * endpoints, so seeing it meant "machine string you might copy", and "this is a number" is
 * not a message worth a face.
 *
 * The premise was true of a system-font stack. It is not true of the ported type language:
 * the site's one small-label utility IS the mono face (`font-family: var(--font-mono);
 * font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1`), so mono is now on every eyebrow label on every screen.
 * It no longer says "identifier" — it says "measured" — and W1.1 asks for monospace on every
 * numeral. What still separates an identifier from a figure is the tracking and the size
 * step, not the family.
 *
 * The assertion is kept, inverted, rather than deleted: a future "restore the sans numerals"
 * cleanup should have to argue with this, not slip past a gap.
