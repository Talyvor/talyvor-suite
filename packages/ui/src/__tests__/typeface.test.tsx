/**
 * THE TYPEFACE, AND THE NUMERAL FACE.

 * The public site is set in Space Grotesk with IBM Plex Mono, and its `.font-instrument`
 * utility — the one it puts on every eyebrow label AND every quoted figure — is literally
 * `font-family: var(--font-mono); font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1`. Porting the language
 * without porting the faces would leave the most visible half of it undone.
 *
 * ⚠ A WEBFONT IS THE `text/html` 200 OF TYPOGRAPHY. An @font-face whose file 404s does
 * not error, does not warn, and does not look broken — the browser silently falls back to
 * the system stack and the page renders in the wrong typeface forever. So this asserts the
 * FILES, not the declaration: every url() in theme.css must resolve to something on disk
 * whose first four bytes are `wOF2`.

/**
 * THE TWO CODE SWEEPS' OTHER INPUT: WHICH FILES THEY READ, AND IT WAS THE UNCONTROLLED ONE.
 *
 * Both sweeps below carry a case named "the sweep is not passing by finding nothing" / "and the
 * sweep would still see one". Read them: each hands the PREDICATE a hand-written string and checks
 * it matches. That controls the regex. It says nothing whatever about the walk, and an absence
 * guard's output for "read nothing" is byte-identical to its output for "read everything and found
 * no offender": `[]`.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS FILE WAS EXPLICITLY CLEARED BY THE PREVIOUS CENSUS, AND THE STATED REASON WAS NOT WHAT IS
 * IN THE FILE. It recorded typeface.test.tsx as one that "walks packages/ui/src and never reads
 * apps/web/src at all, so removing areas/ COULD NOT have moved them". Both sweeps read
 * `[uiSrc, resolve(uiSrc, '../../../apps/web/src')]`. The census's CONCLUSION happened to hold
 * because its control was UNARMED — no mutation that only removes files can move an absence guard,
 * whatever it reads — but the reason it wrote down would have stopped the next tab re-asking.
 *
 * SO IT WAS RE-ASKED ARMED, at 4ed0e79 (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-uiwalk-controls-9e73.py`, every
 * mutation anchor-count-asserted before the edit, restored in a `finally` and verified back by
 * sha256, verdicts read from vitest's own per-test lines), 6/6 as predicted:
 *   T1 `tabular-nums` in a REAL screen at apps/web/src/areas/lens/Ledger.tsx -> REDS the sweep, so
 *      its population really does reach across the repo.
 *   T2 THE HOLE: the same class + ONE line so the walk does not descend into `areas` -> GREEN.
 *   T3/T4 the same pair for `tracking-wide` and the eyebrow sweep -> red, then GREEN.
 *   T5/T6 AND IT IS BLIND IN ITS OWN PACKAGE TOO: `tabular-nums` in a real
 *      packages/ui/src/components/Card.tsx -> red; plus one line skipping `components` -> GREEN.
 *      18 of the 32 production files in packages/ui/src live there.
 *
 * The repair is the one #183 shipped and #184 carried to the three sweeps over apps/web/src: an
 * INDEPENDENT ENUMERATION. `import.meta.glob` is resolved by Vite at transform time and touches
 * `node:fs` not at all, so a skip map, a changed extension filter or a wrong root cannot move both
 * instruments the same way. Compared BOTH DIRECTIONS, with one floor for the single failure that
 * CAN move both: a root resolving to an empty tree.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THERE IS NOW ONE WALK WHERE THERE WERE TWO. They were byte-identical apart from the
 * predicate, which is the shape this repo already refuses elsewhere — "two copies of a scanner is
 * two chances for only one of them to be right" (deadClasses.test.ts on `stripComments`). One walk
 * means the guard below speaks for both sweeps rather than for a copy of one of them.
 *
 * ⚠ IT PASSED ON ITS FIRST RUN, so every assertion in it has its own control and every verdict is
 * read from the FAILING TEST NAME rather than from the file's exit code
 * (`~/talyvor-queue/w11-uiwalk-guard-controls-9e73.py`, 8/8):
 *   P1 walk skips `areas/` → the SET comparison reds and it is the ONLY newly-failing case, so
 *      neither original sweep is the one answering.
 *   P2 the glob pointed at a directory that does not exist → the FLOOR *and* the SET red, so the
 *      floor is armed rather than decorative.
 *   P3 the walk widened to keep `.test.*` → the SET reds, AND SO DO BOTH ORIGINAL SWEEPS. Recorded
 *      because it CONFIRMS the exclusion's stated reason rather than merely repeating it:
 *      design-fixes.test.tsx really does name `tabular-nums` and `tracking-wide` in assertions that
 *      they are absent, so the sweeps are kept off their own fixtures by that filter and by nothing
 *      else.
 *   P4 the defect with the walk intact → the ORIGINAL sweep reds ALONE and the SET stays green, so
 *      the repair was ADDED to the sweeps rather than swapped in for them.
 *   P5 the T2 combination → CAUGHT. The flip is the finding.
 *   P6 BLINDING: this block skipped and the defect + skip restored → rc=0, NOT CAUGHT. Nothing else
 *      in either package was watching.
 *   P7 the own-package half: a defect in `components/` plus one line skipping `components` →
 *      CAUGHT, so T6 is closed as well as T2/T4.
 *   G1 a new production file that both instruments can see → STAYS GREEN. A set comparison, not a
 *      snapshot somebody would re-baseline.
 */
/**
 * ⚠ THE TYPE, NOT THE INSTRUMENT. This package does not depend on `vite` — vitest brings it
 * transitively, so the RUNTIME has the real transform-time glob, but `vite/client`'s types are not
 * resolvable from packages/ui/node_modules (apps/web, which does depend on vite, needs none of
 * this). The ONE method used is declared here rather than adding a dependency to the package graph
 * for the sake of a type. It is deliberately narrower than Vite's: the value is only ever handed to
 * `Object.keys`, so this signature cannot change what the guard below measures — and if it ever
 * drifted, the controls exercise the real glob, not this declaration.
