          A card header is a SECTION TITLE, and this component is the one seam all 39 of them
          behind the gate go through. As a div they were anonymous boxes: measured in Chrome on
          the built artifact, /setup renders nine of them and the whole page held ONE heading
          element, so a screen-reader user pressing H got "Setup" and then nothing. `a19c18f`
          (#126) promoted the PAGE NAME to `<h1>` and stopped one level short.
          The product had already decided this on the pages a stranger sees — legalParts.tsx
          writes `<h2 className="text-head text-ink">`, which is why /privacy and /terms measured
          1>2>2>2… while every console screen measured 1.
          Zero-pixel by construction: preflight sets `h1,…,h6{font-size:inherit;font-weight:
          inherit}` and `…,h1,…{margin:0}`, so `.text-head` supplies the type either way — the
          same reason #126's promotion was byte-identical.
          apps/web/src/CardHeaderHeading.test.tsx holds the element, the level, the sweep across
          every gated address, and the over-correction it refuses. */}
