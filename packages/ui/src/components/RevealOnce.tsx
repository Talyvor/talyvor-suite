// The one-time-credential pattern, promoted from the lens /keys screen so no
// future credential UI (service tokens, key rotation, admin bootstrap)
// reinvents its safety properties:
//
//   · The SECRET is the only body-size string on the card and owns the only
//     primary action — Copy — which copies the secret and nothing else.
//   · The IDENTIFIER never sits beside the secret at equal weight: separated
//     block, caption type, labeled "not a credential" in words — never a hue.
//   · Dismissal is explicit and final: onDone fires once; the CONSUMER
//     unmounts the card and must never re-render the secret (the lens /keys
//     suite proves that end-to-end; this component's contract tests live in
//     packages/ui/src/__tests__/promotions.test.tsx).

  //   · `navigator.clipboard` IS NOT INSTALLED OUTSIDE A SECURE CONTEXT. Measured in Chrome on
  //     the shipped bundle served from `http://192.168.100.149:8791`: `isSecureContext` false,
  //     `typeof navigator.clipboard` "undefined", and this line raised
  //     `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'writeText')`.
  //   · `writeText` REJECTS where it does exist — `NotAllowedError: Document is not focused.`
  //     on https when the tab is not frontmost, or a denied `clipboard-write`.
  // Neither reached the reader: the label stayed put, the live region stayed empty, and the
  // failure's whole itinerary was `window.onerror`. On THIS card that is the dangerous
  // direction to be wrong in — the secret is shown once and the next control destroys it.
  // ⚠ `writeText` IS CALLED SYNCHRONOUSLY, AND A `try` — NOT AN AWAIT — IS WHY.
  // The absent-clipboard case is a THROW and the refused case is a REJECTION, so the obvious
  // shape is `Promise.resolve().then(() => …writeText(…))`, which funnels both into one
  // handler. It also moves the call out of the click's own turn, and a clipboard write outside
  // the user gesture that provoked it is exactly what Safari refuses. `promotions.test.tsx`
  // caught that: it asserts the write happens on the click, and it went red.
  // ⚠ THE RESET MUST NOT OUTLIVE THE COMPONENT — the same defect Setup.tsx carried, in the file
  // Setup.tsx's own comment cites as its model. Uncancelled, this fires `setCopyState` on an
  // unmounted tree, and under vitest into a torn-down jsdom, which reds the RUN rather than a
  // test. Found by measurement, not by reading: the first census walked apps/web/src only, and
  // this package sat outside the boundary. src/timerCleanup.test.tsx now walks both trees.
