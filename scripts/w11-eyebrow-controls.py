"""POSITIVE CONTROLS for the eyebrow audit (W1.1, tab-3d5f).

Every control asserts its ANCHOR — the exact bytes, and how many of them — BEFORE it writes,
verifies the bytes actually CHANGED ON DISK, and restores the tree byte-identically afterwards
(verified with `git diff --quiet`, not an exit code).

⚠ A CONTROL THAT BREAKS THE BUILD IS NOT A CONTROL. A syntax error reds every target and reads as
a caught mutation, so each control names the target it must RED and a companion that must stay
GREEN, and a control that reds both is reported SUSPECT rather than CAUGHT.

⚠ `NOT CAUGHT` IS AMBIGUOUS BY ITSELF — a blind guard and a behaviourally inert edit look the
same. Each control therefore states what it PREDICTS, and the harness prints prediction vs
observation so a surprise is visible rather than absorbed.

⚠ THE TWO RULES ARE DELIBERATELY SEPARATED IN THE TARGETS. `eyebrow-test` is the source rule plus
the fixture-driven predicate tests; `overview` / `members` / `pm` are SURFACE tests, where only the
running DOM audit and its floor can speak. A control caught by `eyebrow-test` alone says nothing
about the DOM half, and vice versa — which is the whole reason both exist.
