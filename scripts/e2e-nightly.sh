# B17.5 — THE NIGHTLY TESTERS. Installed ONCE under launchd, and left running:
#
#   scripts/e2e-nightly.sh --install    # launchd starts it at login and again if it stops (B34.2)
#   scripts/e2e-nightly.sh --status     # whether it runs, its pid, the last run and the next
#   scripts/e2e-nightly.sh --now        # one run, now, then exit with the run's status
#   scripts/e2e-nightly.sh --light      # B28.294: the light pass, now — the entry point a cron runs every few hours
#   nohup scripts/e2e-nightly.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 &    # by hand, with nothing to restart it
#
# Each night at E2E_NIGHTLY_AT (default 03:00, this machine's clock) it brings this checkout to main's head,
# then runs the harness — the scenarios for E2E_USERS synthetic users, then E2E_EXPLORERS AI explorers for
# E2E_EXPLORE_MINUTES each — all under ONE hard cap, E2E_CAP_USD. The day's report is appended to docs/e2e/,
# and each new failure is filed in ~/talyvor-queue/BUILD.md (B17.4), and a short summary is put at the top of
# ~/talyvor-queue/TESTERS.md (B25.5). B28.292, B50.7 — every night the run goes on after its scenarios to the deep red-team
# pass under the same cap: one round, and E2E_DEEP_ROUNDS (default 3) on E2E_DEEP_DAY (1 Monday … 7 Sunday, default 7). Its
# FAILs are filed as SECURITY items under B50 and the report lists them first. B28.294 — between
# the nights, --light plays the core money and auth paths for a few users in a few minutes (e2e/src/light.ts) and files its
# FAILs the same way; E2E_CAP_USD is the day's one cap (E2E_DAY_CAP_USD), so each light pass spends only what the nightly
# and the passes before it left of it since E2E_NIGHTLY_AT, and never starts while another run is going on.
# B34.2 — a checkout that cannot be brought to main's head runs nothing:
# the night writes a TESTERS.md entry saying why and which commit it would have tested, and exits 2. Nothing
# here deploys, pushes or commits.
#
# Settings are read from E2E_ENV_FILE (default ~/.config/talyvor/e2e.env) before every run:
#   LENS_SYNTHETIC_KEY=…   E2E_APP_URL=https://app.talyvor.com   E2E_LENS_URL=https://lens.talyvor.com
# and any other E2E_* setting (e2e/README.md). A night without them is logged and skipped.
