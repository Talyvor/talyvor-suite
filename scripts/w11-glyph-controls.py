POSITIVE CONTROLS FOR THE GLYPH-COVERAGE GUARD (W1.1).

Every control makes ONE edit to a real file, runs a real test command, and requires three things
before it counts as a catch:

  1. THE ANCHOR COUNT IS ASSERTED BEFORE THE WRITE. `dc0bd07` shipped two controls that never ran
     — counts of 5 and 0 where 1 was expected — and reported a no-op as evidence. An anchor that
     does not match is a FAILED control here, never a silent skip.
  2. THE RED MUST SAY THE THING IT IS SUPPOSED TO SAY. `89bd58d`'s C2 reddened a whole file for an
     unrelated reason and was nearly written down as this audit's catch. A control that goes red
     without naming its own defect is reported as UNPROVEN.
  3. A COMPANION TEST MUST STAY GREEN. A control that breaks the build — a syntax error, a missing
     import — reds everything, and "everything is red" is not evidence that this guard saw
     anything. Each control names a test that must still pass in the same run.

Every file is restored and its sha256 compared with the original.
